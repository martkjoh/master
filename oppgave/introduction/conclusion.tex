\section{Summary}


In this thesis, we have investigated the high isospin ground state of QCD---the pion conde condensed phase---and modeled how it might form compact astronomical objects, pion stars.
Pion stars were first proposed by \citeauthor{carignanoScrutinizingPionCondensed2017} in \autocite{carignanoScrutinizingPionCondensed2017} and investigated by \citeauthor{brandtNewClassCompact2018} in \autocite{brandtNewClassCompact2018}, in which they obtained the equations of states of the systems discussed in this text, using QCD lattice methods.
Pion stars have, furthermore, been explored using the linear sigma model and the $1/N$-expansion by \citeauthor{andersenBoseEinsteinCondensationPion2018}~\autocite{andersenBoseEinsteinCondensationPion2018}.


\subsection{Pion condensate}

We investigated the meson sector of zero-temperature quantum chromodynamics using three-flavor chiral perturbation theory.
By exploiting the spontaneous breaking of the approximate $\Lie{SU}{3}_L\times\Lie{SU}{3}_R$ symmetry of the three lightest quarks, the up, down and strange quarks, one can construct an effective field theory of the resulting pseudo-Goldstone bosons.
With this effective theory, we calculated the phase diagram in the $\mu_S-\mu_I$-plane at $T = 0$.
At $\mu_I = m_\pi$, a second-order phase transition from the vacuum phase into the pion-condensed phase occurs.
Similar, second-order transitions occur between the vacuum phase and the charged and neutral kaon-condensed phase.
These condensed phases are separated by first-order phase transitions.
We calculated the effects of electromagnetic interactions on this phase diagram.

Focusing on the pion-condensed phase, we found the equation of state to leading order, next-to-leading order, and including the effects of electromagnetism.
Furtheremore, we found the equations of state of systems of a pion condensate together with charged leptons.
This creates a charge-neutral medium, which is more realistic as a basis for astronomical objects.
Lastly, we included the effects of weak interactions and calculated the equation of state of the $\pi\ell\nu_\ell$-system in which the pion condensate, charged leptons and neutrinos are in chemical equillibrium to next-to-leading order.


\subsection{Pion stars}

The pion condensate equations of state were used, in conjunction with the TOV equation of general-relativistic, to model gravitationally bound matter in hydrostatic equilibrium, pion stars.
We calculated the energy and pressure distribution of pion stars of the various media, and thus obtained the mass-radius relations.
The size and mass of pion stars vary greatly based on their composition, as well as whether the radius increases or decreases as its mass increase.
Our results are in good agreement with earlier results~\autocite{andersenBoseEinsteinCondensationPion2018,brandtNewClassCompact2018}.

We showed analytically that the limiting radius of the pion star of a pure pion condensate with only strong interactions is $R = 85.97\,\text{km}$, and becomes $R = 80.40\,\text{km}$ when including electromagnetic interactions.
We further showed that the equation of state of the $\pi\ell\nu_\ell$-system is closely approximated by that of ultrarelativistic fermions or electromagnetic radiation, $u = 3p$, as the neutrino contribution to the equation of state dominates.
The resulting mass-radius relation is therefore mostly defined by the pressure $p_\text{min}$ at the surface of the star, where the pion condensate vanishes and the neutrino atmosphere begins.



\section{Conclusion}

The low-temperature regime of quantum chromodynamics remains an area of great importance where difficulties such as the breakdown of perturbative methods and the sign problem in QCD lattice methods mean that results from first principles are hard to come by.
The $\mu_I-\mu_S$-plane of the phase diagram is one area where we can cross-check the validity of effective models with QCD lattice results.
We showed that the next-to-leading order equation of state of \chpt\, is in good agreement with earlier QCD lattice results, thus strengthening the model.
These analytical results have allowed us to get a better understanding of the properties of pion stars.
We found the limiting mass of the pure pion condensate star and showed that the $\pi\ell\nu_\ell$-system is dominated by the neutrino contribution.



\section{Outlook and further research}

By themselves, pions are unstable particles.
The neutral pion decays mainly via $\pio\rightarrow \gamma\gamma$, and has a mean lifetime of $\tau = 8.45\times 10^{-17}\,\text{s}$
%
~\autocite{particledatagroupReviewParticlePhysics2020}
%
---incredibly short.
The decay of the charged pions is suppressed due to the conservation of electric charge, and their main decay process is $\pipm\rightarrow \mu \nu_\mu$ as discussed in
%
~\autoref{section: charge neturality}.
%
Still, their mean lifetime is only $\tau = 2.60\times 10^{-8}\,\text{s}$
%
~\autocite{particledatagroupReviewParticlePhysics2020}.
%
These timescales are much smaller than that of astronomical objects, which immediately casts some doubt on the research project of pion stars.
However, these results are for the vacuum state.
In the $\pi\ell\nu_\ell$-case the electrons and muons fill the Fermi-sphere up to their Fermi momentum, as we are considering $T = 0$, and the decay is thus Pauli-blocked.
Even if the final decay-states are available, in the pion condensate they are suppressed by $\mu_I^{-3}$~\autocite{brandtNewClassCompact2018}.

For a more complete understanding of pion stars, an understanding of their evolutions is required.
An investigation of the decay of the pion condensate is then necessary.
The most realistic case, the $\pi\ell\nu_\ell$ system, has a neutrino atmosphere.
We expect this atmosphere to evaporate.
This will change the conditions at the surface of the star, such as the surface pressure $p_\text{min}$.
We found that this was crucial for the mass-radius relation, so a more realistic model must take this into account.

\todo[inline]{Higgs-fasen}


Pion stars, like neutron stars, are compact objects.
This allows us to approximate them as having zero temperature, as $\mu \gg T$.
A more realistic model would take into account thermal effects.
This is especially important in the case of the $\pi\ell\nu_\ell$-system.
Due to the dominating contribution to the equation of state from the neutrinos, the isospin density remains small even at the core of the most massive star.
\todo[]{inkludere isospin density i tabell?}
The isospin chemical potential is just $0.02\,m_\pi$ above the pion condensation transition.
\todo[]{er dette egt. den relevante parameteren for sammenligning med T?}
This suggests that thermal effects could play an important role.


It has been shown that high neutrino densities can cause the condensation of pions~\autocite{abukiPionCondensationDense2009}.
