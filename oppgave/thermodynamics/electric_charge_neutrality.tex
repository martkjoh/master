\section{Electric charge neutrality}
\label{section: charge neturality}


A pion condensate will have an electric charge.
In the grand canonical ensemble, the QCD Lagrangian will have the term  $\mu_Q e\bar q \gamma^0 Q q$, where $e \bar q \gamma^\mu Q q$ is the electric current density, $Q$ the quark charge matrix \autoref{three-flavor charge matrix}, and $e \mu_Q = \mu_I + 2 \mu_S$ is the electric charge chemical potential.
In the case of $\mu_S = 0$, the charge density is
%
\begin{equation}
    n_Q = - \pdv{\Eff}{\mu_Q} = e n_I.
\end{equation}
%
A realistic astrophysical object will not have a macroscopic electric charge.
Therefore, we will model pion stars with the additional constraint of charge neutrality by including charged leptons, of muons or electrons, as free fermions.
\todo[inline]{nevn at en egt. burde ta med en-loop effekter for å få helt konsekvent rekkeutvikling.}
These leptons have an electric charge of $- e$.
We may therefore use the results from \autoref{section: cold fermi star} and \autoref{section: fermions}.
The electric charge density of the leptons is given $- e n_\ell$, where $n_\ell$ is the particle number, the lepton number.
In \autoref{Fermi gas particle density}, we found the expression
%
\begin{equation}
    \label{lepton density}
    n_{\ell} = \frac{8}{3} 
    \frac{u_{\ell, 0}}{m_\ell} x_f^3,
\end{equation}
%
where $x_f = \sqrt{ {\mu_\ell^2}/{m_\ell^2} - 1}$ is the dimensionless Fermi momentum, $m_\ell$ the lepton mass, and $\mu_\ell$ the lepton chemical potential.
This formula is valid for $\mu_\ell \geq m_\ell$.
We have introduced the characteristic energy density of leptons,
%
\begin{equation}
    u_{\ell, 0} = \frac{m^4_\ell}{8 \pi^2}.
\end{equation}
%
The criterion for charge neutrality is then
%
\begin{equation}
    \label{criterion charge neutrality}
    n_I = n_\ell.
\end{equation}
%
With this, we can determine the lepton chemical potential as a function of the isospin chemical potential, $\mu_\ell = \mu_\ell(\mu_I)$.
The leading order result for the isospin density of the pion condensate is given in \autoref{isospin density}.
Inserting the expressions for these densities into \autoref{criterion charge neutrality}, we get
%
\begin{equation}
    \label{equation mu ell mu I}
    A \left(\frac{\mu_\ell^2 }{m_\ell^2} - 1 \right)^{3/2}
    = \frac{\mu_I}{m_\pi}\left( 1 - \frac{m_\pi^4}{\mu_I^4}  \right).
\end{equation}
%
Both densities vanish at the point $(\mu_I, \mu_\ell) = (m_\pi, m_\ell)$, which we have seen earlier is the point where the pressure and energy density of both the Fermi gas and the pion condensate vanish.
We have introduced the dimensionless constant
%
\begin{equation}
    A = \frac{8}{3} \frac{m_\pi} {m_\ell} \frac{u_{0, \ell}}{u_0}
    = \frac{1}{3 \pi^2} \frac{m_\ell^3}{m_\pi f_\pi^2}.
\end{equation}
%
Setting the lepton mass equal the electron mass or muon mass gives, respectively, $A = 3.9 \times10^{- 9}$ and $A = 3.5 \times 10^{-2}$.
In this case, we can write the expression for $\mu_\ell(\mu_I)$ as an explicit function,
%
\begin{equation}
    \label{mu ell from mu I}
    \frac{\mu_\ell}{m_\ell}
    =
    \sqrt{
        1 + A^{-2/3}
        \left[
            \frac{\mu_I}{m_\pi}\left( 1 - \frac{m_\pi^4}{\mu_I^4}  \right)
        \right]^{2/3}
    }.
\end{equation}
%
These relationships are illustrated in \autoref{fig: chemical potentials}.
The plot on the left is the electron chemical potential as a function of isospin chemical potential, both normalized to the masses of their corresponding particles, while the muon chemical potential is on the right.
We see that both lepton potentials are suppressed, relative to the isospin chemical potential, by the $A$ constant in \autoref{equation mu ell mu I}.
The electron is much lighter than the pion, and therefore grows much faster than the muon chemical potential.

The total pressure and energy density will now be the sum of the contributions from the pion condensate and the leptons.
The lepton contribution to these, which we found in \autoref{Fermi gas energy density} and \autoref{Fermi gas pressure}, is
%
\begin{align}
    u_\ell 
    &= u_{\ell,0} 
    \left[(2x_f^3 + x_f) \sqrt{1 + x_f^2} - \arcsinh\left(x_f\right)\right], \\
    p_\ell
    &=\frac{1}{3} u_{\ell,0}
    \left[(2x_f^3 - 3x_f) \sqrt{1 + x_f^2} + 3\arcsinh\left(x_f\right)\right].
\end{align}
%
The contribution from the pion condensate is, as we found in \autoref{pressure leading order chpt} and \autoref{energy density leading order chpt},
%
\begin{align}
    p_\pi &= \frac{1}{2} u_0 \left( \frac{\mu_I}{m_\pi} - \frac{m_\pi}{\mu_I}\right)^2 \\
    u_\pi &= \frac{1}{2} u_0 \left( 2 + \frac{\mu_I^2}{m_\pi^2} - 3 \frac{m_\pi^2}{\mu_I^2}  \right)
\end{align}
%
This leads to a total pressure and energy
%
\begin{equation}
    p = p_\pi + p_\ell, \quad u = u_\pi + u_\ell.
\end{equation}
%
As \autoref{criterion charge neutrality} gives $\mu_\ell$ as a function of $\mu_I$, these are both parametrized by the isospin chemical potential, and we can extract the equation of state $u = u(p)$.
The full equation of state in different regimes is shown in \autoref{fig: eos with leptons}.
On the top left, the addition of the electron results in a much stiffer equation of state than the addition of the muon.
We have seen that the low-pressure energy density of the pion is $m_\pi n_I $, while for the lepton, it is $m_\ell n_\ell$.
As $n_I = n_\ell$, the low-pressure limit of the energy density is $(m_\pi + m_\ell)n_ I$, which explains why the muon, where $m_\mu \approx m_\pi$, contributes a lot more to the energy density than the electron, for which $m_e \ll m_\pi$.
We see that the pion contribution dominates the high-pressure regime in the top right plot.
However, as chiral perturbation assumes small pion energies and small external currents, this result must be used carefully.
The equation of state in an intermediate-range is shown on the bottom.
It is not very sensitive to the lepton mass, at least as long as it is less than the pion mass.

    }
    \label{fig: eos with leptons}
\end{figure}

We can find the ultrarelativistic limit by letting $\mu_I^2/m_\pi^2 = y$, $y \gg 1$.
From \autoref{mu ell from mu I}, we find that the lepton chemical potential to leading order in $y$ is $\mu_\ell^2 \propto y^{1/3}$.
In \autoref{section: cold fermi star}, we found that in the ultrarelativistic limit of non-interacting fermions, both the pressure and energy is proportional to $x_f^4 \propto y^{2/3}$.
In the case of the pion, however, both are proportional to $\mu_I^2 \propto y$.
Therefore, the ultrarelativistic limit of the combined system is, to leading order, given by the ultrarelativistic limit of the pion condensate alone.

As before, we can find the non-relativisitic limit by letting $\mu_I^2/m_\pi^2 = 1 + \epsilon$.
Inserting this into \autoref{mu ell from mu I} and expanding to first order in $\epsilon$, we get $\mu_\ell^2/m_\ell^2 = 1 + (2 A^{-1} \epsilon)^{2/3} $.
This is equivalent to $x_f = (2 A^{-1} \epsilon)^{1/3} $.
In \autoref{section: cold fermi star}, we found the non-relativistic limit of the pressure and energy of the Fermi gas, i.e., the lowest order contribution in $x_f$, as $x_f \rightarrow 0$.
Inserting this new result into these limits, we get the leading low energy limits of the pressure and energy, 
%
\begin{equation}
    u_{\ell, \text{nr}} = \frac{8}{3} \frac{2}{A} u_{\ell,0} \epsilon, \quad
    p_{\ell, \text{nr}} = \frac{8}{15} \left(\frac{2}{A} \right)^{5/3}  u_{\ell,0}  \epsilon^{5/3}.
\end{equation}
%
From \autoref{section: thermodynamics leading order}, we have the equivalent expressions for the pion condensate,
%
\begin{equation}
    u_{\pi, \text{nr}} = 2 u_0 \epsilon, \quad p_{\pi, \text{nr}} = \frac{1}{2} u_0 \epsilon^2.
\end{equation}
%
As we see, the energy density of the pion condensate and the leptons are of the same order, and both will therefore contribute to the leading order energy density.
However, the lepton pressure is of a lower order, and \emph{only} this will contribute to the leading order pressure.
At low enough isospin chemical potential, then, the leading order behavior of the combined system is
%
\begin{equation}
    u_{\text{nr}} 
    = 2 u_0 \left(1 + \frac{1}{2}\frac{m_\ell}{m_\pi} \right)  \epsilon, \quad
    p_{\text{nr}} = \frac{8}{15} u_{\ell,0} \left(\frac{2}{A} \right)^{5/3} \epsilon^{5/3}.
\end{equation}
%
The equation of state is now a polytrope with $\gamma = \frac{5}{3}$, different from the $\gamma = 2$ polytrope of only the pion condensate.
For a heavy lepton, $m_\ell \gg m_\pi$, the factor $\smash{A^{-\frac{5}{3}}}$ would suppress the leading order of the lepton contribution to the pressure.
Thus, the equation of state would have an intermediate range in which it would be well approximated as a polytrope with $\gamma = 2$, and a modified poly tropic constant $K'^{-1} = 8 (1 + \frac{1}{2} m_\ell/m_\pi)^2$.
The full equation of state is compared to the non-relativistic limit in \autoref{fig: lepton eos limit}.

\subsection{Neutrinos}
\label{subsection: neutrinos}

The primary decay mode for charged pions is via the weak force.
The $W^\pm$ bosons, which together with the $Z$ boson mediate the weak force, couple to quarks, charged leptons $\ell$ and their corresponding neutrinos $\nu_\ell$.
Neutrinos are very light leptons that only interact via the weak force.
The exact nature of the mass of neutrinos is still an open problem~\Autocite{schwartzQuantumFieldTheory2013}.
In this thesis, we will regard the neutrinos as massless.
The leading order diagrams for the relevant interactions are
%
\begin{equation*}
    \feynmandiagram [horizontal=a to b]{
        u [particle=$u$] 
        -- [fermion] a -- [fermion]
        d [particle=$\bar d$], 
        a -- [photon, edge label=$W^+ $] b,
        ell [particle=$\ell^+$] -- [fermion] b -- [fermion]
        nu [particle=$\nu_\ell$]
        };
    \quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad
    \feynmandiagram [horizontal=a to b]{
        u [particle=$\bar u$]
        -- [anti fermion] a -- [anti fermion]
        d [particle=$d$], 
        a -- [photon, edge label=$W^-$] b,
        ell [particle=$\ell^-$] -- [anti fermion] b -- [anti fermion]
        nu [particle=$\bar \nu_\ell$]
        };
\end{equation*}
%
The $W^\pm$ boson only couples to left-handed fermions, $\psi_L = P_L \psi$, as discussed in \autoref{subsection: chiral symmetry}.
Therefore, the coupling has the form $W^\pm_\mu \bar \psi_L \gamma^\mu \psi_L$.
This will result in effective interactions of the form
%
\begin{equation*}
    \feynmandiagram [horizontal=a to b]{
        pi [particle=$\pi^+$] -- [fermion] a  [blob], 
        a -- [photon, edge label=$W^+ $] b,
        ell [particle=$\ell^+$] -- [fermion] b -- [fermion]
        nu [particle=$\nu_\ell$]
        };
        \quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad
        \feynmandiagram [horizontal=a to b]{
            pi [particle=$\pi^-$] -- [fermion] a  [blob], 
            a -- [photon, edge label=$W^- $] b,
            ell [particle=$\ell^-$] -- [anti fermion] b -- [anti fermion]
            nu [particle=$\bar \nu_\ell$]
            };
\end{equation*}
%
Here, the shaded circle represents the effective interaction between the pions and the $W^\pm$ bosons.
Although the $\pi \rightarrow e \nu_e$ decay has a larger phase-space than $\pi \rightarrow \mu \nu_\mu$ due to the lighter mass of the electron, the latter decay mode is dominating.
This is due to \emph{helicity suppression}.
In the zero-mass limit, the helicity of a particle, i.e., the alignment of spin and momentum, is given by its chirality.
A left-handed, massless particle has helicity $h = -1$ and the corresponding antiparticle has $h = 1$.
The decay product from a weak interaction has the same chirality and thus opposite helicity, which is forbidden by the conservation of linear and angular momentum.
This effect suppresses the decay into the light electron~\autocite{griffithsIntroductionElementaryParticles2008}.

We treat neutrinos $\nu_\ell$ as free, massless fermions, with chemical potentials $\mu_{\nu_\ell}$.
In chemical equilibrium, the processes $\pi^+ \leftrightarrow \ell^+ \nu_\ell $ and $\pi^- \leftrightarrow \ell^- \bar\nu_\ell $ are balanced, and the chemical potentials therefore obey
%
\begin{equation}
    \label{chemical equilibrium weak interaction}
    \mu_I = \mu_{\nu_\ell} - \mu_\ell.
\end{equation}
%
Even though we regard the neutrinos as massless when working with the dynamics, the non-zero mass will affect the results via \emph{neutrino oscillations}.
As the mass eigenstates of neutrinos are not the same as the flavor eigenstates, the neutrino spontaneously and continuously undergoes processes of the form $\nu_\ell \rightarrow \nu_{\ell'}$.
As a result, neither the individual lepton particle numbers $n_{\nu_\ell}$ and $n_{\ell}$, nor individual lepton numbers $L_\ell = n_\ell + n_{\nu_\ell}$ are conserved.
However, the sum of all lepton numbers is conserved.
In chemical equilibrium, neutrino oscillations will result in the relationship
%
\begin{equation}
    \mu_{\nu_e} = \mu_{\nu_\mu}.
\end{equation}
%
Or, using \autoref{chemical equilibrium weak interaction}, $\mu_e = \mu_\mu$.
The equation for charge neutrality now becomes $n_I = n_e + n_\mu$, or
%
\begin{equation}
    \label{chemical potential relationship neutrinos}
    \frac{\mu_I}{m_\pi} \left(1 - \frac{m_\pi^4}{\mu_I^4}\right)
    =
    \theta(\mu_e - m_e) 
    A_e \sqrt{\frac{\mu_e^2}{m_e^2} - 1}
    +
    \theta(\mu_e - m_\mu)
    A_\mu \sqrt{a^2 \frac{\mu_e^2}{m_e^2} - 1},
\end{equation}
%
where $a = m_e/m_\mu \approx 1 / 200$.
Thus, for $\mu_e < m_\mu$, there will be no muons. 
The relationship between $\mu_e$ and $\mu_I$ is the same as with only pions and electrons, while it deviates for $\mu_e > m_\mu$.
These results are compared in \autoref{fig: neutrino mu}.
The plot also illustrates the derivative of $\mu_e$ with respect to $\mu_I$, which remains continuous even at the point where muons start to contribute.

    }
    \label{fig: neutrino mu}
\end{figure}


The pressure and energy from the neutrinos are given by the ultrarelativistic limit of the free fermion results, which we found in \autoref{section: cold fermi star}.
These results are divided by two, as there are only left-handed neutrinos, and thus only half as many degrees of freedom as fermions where both chiralities appear.
The chemical potential of a massless particle equals its Fermi momentum, so the result is
%
\begin{equation}
    u_{\nu_\ell} = \frac{\mu_{\nu_\ell}^4}{8 \pi^2}, \quad 
    p_{\nu_\ell} = \frac{\mu_{\nu_\ell}^4}{24 \pi^2}.
\end{equation}
%

The total pressure and energy density is now, as before, the sum of the individual contribution from each species,
%
\begin{equation}
    \label{total energy and pressure neutrino}
    p = p_\pi + p_e + p_\mu + p_{\nu_e} + p_{\nu_\mu}, \quad
    u = u_\pi + u_e + u_\mu + u_{\nu_e} + u_{\nu_\mu}.
\end{equation}
%

    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{../scripts/figurer/neutrino_contributions.pdf}
    \caption{
        The contributions to energy density and pressure from the pion condensate, $\pi$, the charged leptons $\ell$ and the corresponding neutrinos $\nu_\ell$, in various domains.
        }
    \label{fig: contributions neutrino system}
\end{figure}

The various contributions to the energy density and pressure are shown in \autoref{fig: contributions neutrino system}.
As before, the criterion of charge neutrality \autoref{chemical potential relationship neutrinos} ensures that the transition into the vacuum phase for the pion condensate, at $\mu_I = m_\pi$, happens simultaneously as the charged lepton density vanishes, here at $\mu_e = m_e$.
However, due to the weak-interaction chemical equilibrium, \autoref{chemical equilibrium weak interaction}, the neutrino chemical potential and thus the neutrino pressure will be non-zero even with no pion condensate nor any charged leptons. 
As both the electron and muon neutrino contributes, the pressure is
%
\begin{equation}
    \label{p min}
    p_\text{min} = \frac{(m_\pi+m_e)^4}{12 \pi^2}.
\end{equation}
%
After this point, $\mu_I$ and $\mu_\ell$ do not have a strict functional relationship, as \autoref{chemical potential relationship neutrinos} no longer applies.
The equation of state is then given only by the neutrinos and is $u = 3p$.
This is not correct for arbitrarily low pressure, as the finite neutrino mass will at some point become relevant.
The equation of state of the full system is shown in \autoref{fig: neutrino eos}, where it is compared to the equation of state of only neutrinos.
