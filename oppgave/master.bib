  abstract = {Pion stars consisting of Bose-Einstein condensed charged pions have recently been proposed as a new class of compact stars. We use the two-particle irreducible effective action to leading order in the \$1/N\$-expansion to describe charged and neutrals pions as well as the sigma particle. Tuning the parameters in the Lagrangian correctly, the onset of Bose-Einstein condesation of charged pions is exactly at \$\textbackslash mu\_I=m\_\{\textbackslash pi\}\$, where \$\textbackslash mu\_I\$ is the isospin chemical potential. We calculate the pressure, energy density, and equation of state, which are used as input to the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkov equations. Solving these equations, we obtain the mass radius-relation for pion stars. Global electric charge neutrality is ensured by adding the contribution to the pressure and energy density from a gas of free relativistic leptons. We compare our results with those of recent lattice simulations and find good agreement. The masses of the pion stars are up to approximately 200 solar masses while the corresponding radii are of the order of \$10\^5\$ km.},

  abstract = {This book is an introductory textbook to statistical mechanics that carefully develops new concepts and ideas from basic assumptions and established results. Written for university students in physics and engineering, the prerequisites are mathematics courses on analysis and linear algebra, as well as physics courses on classical mechanics, quantum mechanics, and thermodynamics. The first two chapters cover basic probability theory, Markov processes, and classical mechanics. The next three chapters cover ensemble theory with applications to spin systems, lattice vibrations, and black-body radiation. This is followed by a chapter devoted to quantum statistical mechanics and the derivation of the Bose-Einstein and Fermi-Dirac distribution functions. The theory is applied to understand the fascinating white dwarfs, semiconductors, and the quark-gluon plasma. The book is equipped with an appendix that covers useful mathematical material. Each chapter contains a number of exercises that are helpful in understanding the concepts.},

Allowed changes in the field variables, which do not change the on-shell S matrix, must leave the origin fixed. By a suitable choice of fields, the transformations induced by the group on the manifold of the phenomenological fields can be made to have standard forms, which are described in detail. The mathematical problem is equivalent to that of finding all (nonlinear) realizations of a (compact, connected, semisimple) Lie group which become linear when restricted to a given subgroup. The relation between linear representations and nonlinear realization is discussed. The important special case of the chiral groups SU(2)\texttimes SU(2) and SU(3)\texttimes SU(3) is considered in detail.},

In the second section we introduce an additional structure, called a smooth structure, that can be added to a topological manifold to enable us to do calculus. Following the basic definitions, we introduce a number of examples of manifolds, so you can have something concrete in mind as you read the general theory. At the end of the chapter we introduce the concept of a smooth manifold with boundary, an important generalization of smooth manifolds that will have numerous applications throughout the book.},

Special attention is given to the short-distance dynamical information encoded in the low-energy couplings of the effective Lagrangians.

  abstract = {The effective Lagrangian for Nambu-Goldstone bosons (NGBs) in systems without Lorentz invariance has a novel feature that some of the NGBs are canonically conjugate to each other, hence describing \$1\$ dynamical degree of freedom by two NGB fields. We develop explicit forms of their effective Lagrangian up to the quadratic order in derivatives. We clarify the counting rules of NGB degrees of freedom and completely classify possibilities of such canonically conjugate pairs based on the topology of the coset spaces. Its consequence on the dispersion relations of the NGBs is clarified. We also present simple scaling arguments to see whether interactions among NGBs are marginal or irrelevant, which justifies a lore in the literature about the possibility of symmetry breaking in \$1+1\$ dimensions.},

  abstract = {Available for the first time in paperback, The Quantum Theory of Fields is a self-contained, comprehensive, and up-to-date introduction to quantum field theory from Nobel Laureate Steven Weinberg. Volume I introduces the foundations of quantum field theory. The development is fresh and logical throughout, with each step carefully motivated by what has gone before. After a brief historical outline, the book begins with the principles of relativity and quantum mechanics, and the properties of particles that follow. Quantum field theory emerges from this as a natural consequence. The classic calculations of quantum electrodynamics are presented in a thoroughly modern way, showing the use of path integrals and dimensional regularization. It contains much original material, and is peppered with examples and insights drawn from the author's experience as a leader of elementary particle research. Exercises are included at the end of each chapter.},

  abstract = {The Quantum Theory of Fields, first published in 1996, is a self-contained, comprehensive introduction to quantum field theory from Nobel Laureate Steven Weinberg. Volume II gives an account of the methods of quantum field theory, and how they have led to an understanding of the weak, strong, and electromagnetic interactions of the elementary particles. The presentation of modern mathematical methods is throughout interwoven with accounts of the problems of elementary particle physics and condensed matter physics to which they have been applied. Many topics are included that are not usually found in books on quantum field theory. The book is peppered with examples and insights from the author's experience as a leader of elementary particle physics. Exercises are included at the end of each chapter.},
