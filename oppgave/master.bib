  abstract = {In this paper, we calculate the equation of state of two-flavor finite isospin chiral perturbation theory at next-to-leading order in the pion-condensed phase at zero temperature. We show that the transition from the vacuum phase to a Bose-condensed phase is of second order. While the tree-level result has been known for some time, surprisingly quantum effects have not yet been incorporated into the equation of state. We find that the corrections to the quantities we compute, namely the isospin density, pressure, and equation of state, increase with increasing isospin chemical potential. We compare our results to recent lattice simulations of 2+1 flavor QCD with physical quark masses. The agreement with the lattice results is generally good and improves somewhat as we go from leading order to next-to-leading order in \$\textbackslash chi\$PT.},

  abstract = {Pion stars consisting of Bose-Einstein condensed charged pions have recently been proposed as a new class of compact stars. We use the two-particle irreducible effective action to leading order in the \$1/N\$-expansion to describe charged and neutrals pions as well as the sigma particle. Tuning the parameters in the Lagrangian correctly, the onset of Bose-Einstein condesation of charged pions is exactly at \$\textbackslash mu\_I=m\_\{\textbackslash pi\}\$, where \$\textbackslash mu\_I\$ is the isospin chemical potential. We calculate the pressure, energy density, and equation of state, which are used as input to the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkov equations. Solving these equations, we obtain the mass radius-relation for pion stars. Global electric charge neutrality is ensured by adding the contribution to the pressure and energy density from a gas of free relativistic leptons. We compare our results with those of recent lattice simulations and find good agreement. The masses of the pion stars are up to approximately 200 solar masses while the corresponding radii are of the order of \$10\^5\$ km.},

By a suitable choice of fields, the transformations induced by the group on the manifold of the phenomenological fields can be made to have standard forms, which are described in detail. The mathematical problem is equivalent to that of finding all (nonlinear) realizations of a (compact, connected, semisimple) Lie group which become linear when restricted to a given subgroup.

  abstract = {Starting with the modern developments of current algebra and the hypothesis of partially conserved axial-vector current, it has gradually become apparent that the strong interactions are almost invariant under the group SU(3){$\otimes$}SU(3). In the limit that symmetry breaking is neglected, SU(3){$\otimes$}SU(3) does not appear as a symmetry of the particle states as SU(3) does, but rather as a symmetry realized by eight Goldstone bosons, i.e., the pseudoscalar octet. Most papers on SU(3){$\otimes$}SU(3) symmetry have been concerned with soft-meson theorems and their connection with effective Lagrangians. This paper is devoted to other aspects of the symmetry. Part of the paper is frankly pedagogical. The physics behind a symmetry realized by way of Goldstone bosons is brought out through a study of the {$\sigma$} model. Then the general principles are stated abstractly and applied to the hadrons. One of the new results presented here is that there are two distinct ways in which SU(3){$\otimes$}SU(3) can be realized. In both cases there is an octet of massless pseudoscalar mesons. The two possibilities differ in the residual symmetry of the hadron spectrum: In one case, it is only SU(3); in the other, it is SU(3) times a discrete symmetry, which leads to parity doublets. It is conjectured that some of the observed parity doubling in nucleon resonances is a consequence of this new discrete symmetry. Symmetry breaking is discussed in detail and is found to be very complex. In particular, it is shown that, at least for the pseudoscalar-meson masses, octet enhancement can never occur for first-order perturbations around an SU(3){$\otimes$}SU(3)-symmetrical limit. Since octet enhancement is an empirical fact, one is forced to conclude that lowest-order perturbation theory is not a good approximation. In connection with octet enhancement, we show how one can use a principle of pole dominance in the angular momentum plane to replace scalar "tadpole" mesons with Regge trajectories.},

Specific physical theories treated include QED, QCD, electroweak theory, and effective nuclear field theories of hadronic and nuclear matter. Topics include: functional integral representation of the partition function, diagrammatic expansions, linear response theory, screening and plasma oscillations, spontaneous symmetry breaking, Goldstone theorem, resummation and hard thermal loops, lattice gauge theory, phase transitions, nucleation theory, quark-gluon plasma, and color superconductivity. Applications to astrophysics and cosmology cover white dwarf and neutron stars, neutrino emissivity, baryon number violation in the early universe, and cosmological phase transitions. Applications to relativistic nucleus-nucleus collisions are also included. The book is written for theorists in elementary particle physics, nuclear physics, astrophysics, and cosmology. Problems are given at the end of each chapter, and numerous references to the literature are included.},

It focuses on developing an in- mate acquaintance with the geometric meaning of curvature. In so doing, it introduces and demonstrates the uses of all the main technical tools needed for a careful study of Riemannian manifolds. I have selected a set of topics that can reasonably be covered in ten to ?fteen weeks, instead of making any attempt to provide an encyclopedic treatment of the subject. The book begins with a careful treatment of the machineryofmetrics,connections,andgeodesics,withoutwhichonecannot claim to be doing Riemannian geometry. It then introduces the Riemann curvature tensor, and quickly moves on to submanifold theory in order to give the curvature tensor a concrete quantitative interpretation. From then on, all e?orts are bent toward proving the four most fundamental theorems relating curvature and topology: the Gauss\textendash Bonnet theorem (expressing thetotalcurvatureofasurfaceintermsofitstopologicaltype),theCartan\textendash{} Hadamard theorem (restricting the topology of manifolds of nonpositive curvature), Bonnet's theorem (giving analogous restrictions on manifolds of strictly positive curvature), and a special case of the Cartan\textendash Ambrose\textendash{} Hicks theorem (characterizing manifolds of constant curvature). Many other results and techniques might reasonably claim a place in an introductory Riemannian geometry course, but could not be included due to time constraints.},

  abstract = {This book is an introductory graduate-level textbook on the theory of smooth manifolds. Its goal is to familiarize students with the tools they will need in order to use manifolds in mathematical or scientific research--- smooth structures, tangent vectors and covectors, vector bundles, immersed and embedded submanifolds, tensors, differential forms, de Rham cohomology, vector fields, flows, foliations, Lie derivatives, Lie groups, Lie algebras, and more. The approach is as concrete as possible, with pictures and intuitive discussions of how one should think geometrically about the abstract concepts, while making full use of the powerful tools that modern mathematics has to offer. Along the way, the book introduces students to some of the most important examples of geometric structures that manifolds can carry, such as Riemannian metrics, symplectic structures, and foliations. The book is aimed at students who already have a solid acquaintance with general topology, the fundamental group, and covering spaces, as well as basic undergraduate linear algebra and real analysis. John M. Lee is Professor of Mathematics at the University of Washington in Seattle, where he regularly teaches graduate courses on the topology and geometry of manifolds. He was the recipient of the American Mathematical Society's Centennial Research Fellowship and he is the author of two previous Springer books, Introduction to Topological Manifolds (2000) and Riemannian Manifolds: An Introduction to Curvature (1997).},

In Chap. 3 the idea of a spontaneous breakdown of a global symmetry is discussed and its consequences in terms of the Goldstone theorem are demonstrated. Chapter 4 deals with mesonic chiral perturbation theory and the principles entering the construction of the chiral Lagrangian are outlined. Various examples with increasing chiral orders and complexity are given. Finally, in Chap. 5 the methods are extended to include the interaction between Goldstone bosons and baryons in the single-baryon sector, with the main emphasis put on the heavy-baryon formulation. At the end, the method of infrared regularization in the relativistic framework is discussed.},

We develop explicit forms of their effective Lagrangian up to the quadratic order in derivatives. We clarify the counting rules of NGB degrees of freedom and completely classify possibilities of such canonically conjugate pairs based on the topology of the coset spaces. Its consequence on the dispersion relations of the NGBs is clarified. We also present simple scaling arguments to see whether interactions among NGBs are marginal or irrelevant, which justifies a lore in the literature about the possibility of symmetry breaking in \$1+1\$ dimensions.},

  abstract = {Editor's note: One of the most important developments in theoretical particle physics at the end of the 20th century and beginning of the twenty-first century has been the development of effective field theories (EFTs). Pursuing an effective field theory approach is a methodology for constructing theories, where a set of core principles is agreed upon, such as Lorentz symmetry and unitarity, and all possible interactions consistent with them are then compulsory in the theory. The utility of this approach to particle physics (and beyond) is wide ranging and undisputed, as evidenced by the recent formation of the international seminar series All Things EFT (Talks in the series can be viewed at https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1\_KF6kdJFoDEcLgpcegwCQ(accessed 21 December 2020).) which brings together each week the worldwide community of EFT practitioners. The text below is a lightly edited version of the talk given by Prof. Weinberg on September 30, 2020, which inaugurated the series. The talk reviews some of the early history of EFTs from the perspective of its pioneer and concludes with a discussion of EFT implications for future discovery.},

Volume I introduces the foundations of quantum field theory. The development is fresh and logical throughout, with each step carefully motivated by what has gone before. After a brief historical outline, the book begins with the principles of relativity and quantum mechanics, and the properties of particles that follow. Quantum field theory emerges from this as a natural consequence. The classic calculations of quantum electrodynamics are presented in a thoroughly modern way, showing the use of path integrals and dimensional regularization. It contains much original material, and is peppered with examples and insights drawn from the author's experience as a leader of elementary particle research. Exercises are included at the end of each chapter.},
