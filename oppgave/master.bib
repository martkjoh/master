  abstract = {Pion stars consisting of Bose-Einstein condensed charged pions have recently been proposed as a new class of compact stars. We use the two-particle irreducible effective action to leading order in the \$1/N\$-expansion to describe charged and neutrals pions as well as the sigma particle. Tuning the parameters in the Lagrangian correctly, the onset of Bose-Einstein condesation of charged pions is exactly at \$\textbackslash mu\_I=m\_\{\textbackslash pi\}\$, where \$\textbackslash mu\_I\$ is the isospin chemical potential. We calculate the pressure, energy density, and equation of state, which are used as input to the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkov equations. Solving these equations, we obtain the mass radius-relation for pion stars. Global electric charge neutrality is ensured by adding the contribution to the pressure and energy density from a gas of free relativistic leptons. We compare our results with those of recent lattice simulations and find good agreement. The masses of the pion stars are up to approximately 200 solar masses while the corresponding radii are of the order of \$10\^5\$ km.},

  abstract = {This book is an introductory textbook to statistical mechanics that carefully develops new concepts and ideas from basic assumptions and established results. Written for university students in physics and engineering, the prerequisites are mathematics courses on analysis and linear algebra, as well as physics courses on classical mechanics, quantum mechanics, and thermodynamics. The first two chapters cover basic probability theory, Markov processes, and classical mechanics. The next three chapters cover ensemble theory with applications to spin systems, lattice vibrations, and black-body radiation. This is followed by a chapter devoted to quantum statistical mechanics and the derivation of the Bose-Einstein and Fermi-Dirac distribution functions. The theory is applied to understand the fascinating white dwarfs, semiconductors, and the quark-gluon plasma. The book is equipped with an appendix that covers useful mathematical material. Each chapter contains a number of exercises that are helpful in understanding the concepts.},

  abstract = {We investigate the viability of a new type of compact star whose main constituent is a Bose-Einstein condensate of charged pions. Several different setups are considered, where a gas of charged leptons and neutrinos is also present. The pionic equation of state is obtained from lattice QCD simulations in the presence of an isospin chemical potential, and requires no modeling of the nuclear force. The gravitationally bound configurations of these systems are found by solving the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkov equations. We discuss weak decays within the pion condensed phase and elaborate on the generation mechanism of such objects.},

We then prove some important topological properties of manifolds that we use throughout the book. In the second section we introduce an additional structure, called a smooth structure, that can be added to a topological manifold to enable us to do calculus. Following the basic definitions, we introduce a number of examples of manifolds, so you can have something concrete in mind as you read the general theory. At the end of the chapter we introduce the concept of a smooth manifold with boundary, an important generalization of smooth manifolds that will have numerous applications throughout the book.},

Using data from previous editions, plus 3,324 new measurements from 878 papers, we list, evaluate, and average measured properties of gauge bosons and the recently discovered Higgs boson, leptons, quarks, mesons, and baryons. We summarize searches for hypothetical particles such as supersymmetric particles, heavy bosons, axions, dark photons, etc. Particle properties and search limits are listed in Summary Tables. We give numerous tables, figures, formulae, and reviews of topics such as Higgs Boson Physics, Supersymmetry, Grand Unified Theories, Neutrino Mixing, Dark Energy, Dark Matter, Cosmology, Particle Detectors, Colliders, Probability and Statistics. Among the 120 reviews are many that are new or heavily revised, including a new review on High Energy Soft QCD and Diffraction and one on the Determination of CKM Angles from B Hadrons.The Review is divided into two volumes. Volume 1 includes the Summary Tables and 98 review articles. Volume 2 consists of the Particle Listings and contains also 22 reviews that address specific aspects of the data presented in the Listings.The complete Review (both volumes) is published online on the website of the Particle Data Group (pdg.lbl.gov) and in a journal. Volume 1 is available in print as the PDG Book. A Particle Physics Booklet with the Summary Tables and essential tables, figures, and equations from selected review articles is available in print and as a web version optimized for use on phones as well as an Android app.},
