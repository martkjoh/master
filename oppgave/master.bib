  abstract = {We argue that using an equilibrated gas of neutrinos it is possible to probe the phase diagram of QCD for finite isospin and small baryon chemical potentials. We discuss this region of the phase diagram in detail and demonstrate that for large enough neutrino densities a Bose\textendash Einstein condensate of positively charged pions arises. Moreover, we show that for non-zero neutrino density the degeneracy in the lifetimes and masses of the charged pions is lifted.},

The comprehensive set of measurements from the first three years of RHIC operation includes charged particle multiplicities, transverse energy, yield ratios and spectra of identified hadrons in a wide range of transverse momenta (pT), elliptic flow, two-particle correlations, nonstatistical fluctuations, and suppression of particle production at high pT. The results are examined with an emphasis on implications for the formation of a new state of dense matter. We find that the state of matter created at RHIC cannot be described in terms of ordinary color neutral hadrons.},

  abstract = {We consider three-flavor chiral perturbation theory ({$\chi$}PT) at zero temperature and nonzero isospin ({$\mu$}I) and strange ({$\mu$}S) chemical potentials. The effective potential is calculated to next-to-leading order (NLO) in the {$\pi\pm$}-condensed phase, the K{$\pm$}-condensed phase, and the \$\$ \{K\}\^0/\{\textbackslash overline\{K\}\}\^0 \$\$-condensed phase. It is shown that the transitions from the vacuum phase to these phases are second order and take place when, \$\$ \textbackslash left|\{\textbackslash mu\}\_I\textbackslash right|=\{m\}\_\{\textbackslash pi \},\textbackslash left|\textbackslash frac\{1\}\{2\}\{\textbackslash mu\}\_I+\{\textbackslash mu\}\_S\textbackslash right|=\{m\}\_K \$\$, and \$\$ \textbackslash left|-\textbackslash frac\{1\}\{2\}\{\textbackslash mu\}\_I+\{\textbackslash mu\}\_S\textbackslash right|=\{m\}\_K \$\$, respectively at tree level and remains unchanged at NLO. The transition between the two condensed phases is first order. The effective potential in the pion-condensed phase is independent of {$\mu$}S and in the kaon-condensed phases, it only depends on the combinations \$\$ \textbackslash pm \textbackslash frac\{1\}\{2\}\{\textbackslash mu\}\_I+\{\textbackslash mu\}\_S \$\$and not separately on {$\mu$}I and {$\mu$}S. We calculate the pressure, isospin density and the equation of state in the pion-condensed phase and compare our results with recent (2 + 1)-flavor lattice QCD data. We find that the three-flavor {$\chi$}PT results are in good agreement with lattice QCD for {$\mu$}I {$<$} 200 MeV, however for larger values {$\chi$}PT produces values for observables that are consistently above lattice results. For {$\mu$}I {$>$} 200 MeV, the two-flavor results are in better agreement with lattice data. Finally, we consider the observables in the limit of very heavy s-quark, where they reduce to their two-flavor counterparts with renormalized couplings. The disagreement between the predictions of two and three flavor {$\chi$}PT can largely be explained by the differences in the experimental values of the low-energy constants.},

  abstract = {Matter at high density and low temperature is expected to be a color superconductor, which is a degenerate Fermi gas of quarks with a condensate of Cooper pairs near the Fermi surface that induces color Meissner effects. At the highest densities, where the QCD coupling is weak, rigorous calculations are possible, and the ground state is a particularly symmetric state, the color-flavor locked (CFL) phase. The CFL phase is a superfluid, an electromagnetic insulator, and breaks chiral symmetry. The effective theory of the low-energy excitations in the CFL phase is known and can be used, even at more moderate densities, to describe its physical properties. At lower densities the CFL phase may be disfavored by stresses that seek to separate the Fermi surfaces of the different flavors, and comparison with the competing alternative phases, which may break translation and/or rotation invariance, is done using phenomenological models. We review the calculations that underlie these results and then discuss transport properties of several color-superconducting phases and their consequences for signatures of color superconductivity in neutron stars.},

We use the two-particle irreducible effective action to leading order in the \$1/N\$-expansion to describe charged and neutrals pions as well as the sigma particle. Tuning the parameters in the Lagrangian correctly, the onset of Bose-Einstein condesation of charged pions is exactly at \$\textbackslash mu\_I=m\_\{\textbackslash pi\}\$, where \$\textbackslash mu\_I\$ is the isospin chemical potential. We calculate the pressure, energy density, and equation of state, which are used as input to the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkov equations. Solving these equations, we obtain the mass radius-relation for pion stars. Global electric charge neutrality is ensured by adding the contribution to the pressure and energy density from a gas of free relativistic leptons. We compare our results with those of recent lattice simulations and find good agreement. The masses of the pion stars are up to approximately 200 solar masses while the corresponding radii are of the order of \$10\^5\$ km.},

Written for university students in physics and engineering, the prerequisites are mathematics courses on analysis and linear algebra, as well as physics courses on classical mechanics, quantum mechanics, and thermodynamics. The first two chapters cover basic probability theory, Markov processes, and classical mechanics. The next three chapters cover ensemble theory with applications to spin systems, lattice vibrations, and black-body radiation. This is followed by a chapter devoted to quantum statistical mechanics and the derivation of the Bose-Einstein and Fermi-Dirac distribution functions. The theory is applied to understand the fascinating white dwarfs, semiconductors, and the quark-gluon plasma. The book is equipped with an appendix that covers useful mathematical material. Each chapter contains a number of exercises that are helpful in understanding the concepts.},

  abstract = {This paper describes the conclusions that can be drawn from the data taken thus far with the PHOBOS detector at RHIC. In the most central Au+Au collisions at the highest beam energy, evidence is found for the formation of a very high energy density system whose description in terms of simple hadronic degrees of freedom is inappropriate. Furthermore, the constituents of this novel system are found to undergo a significant level of interaction. The properties of particle production at RHIC energies are shown to follow a number of simple scaling behaviors, some of which continue trends found at lower energies or in simpler systems. As a function of centrality, the total number of charged particles scales with the number of participating nucleons. When comparing Au+Au at different centralities, the dependence of the yield on the number of participants at higher pT ({$\sim$}4~GeV/c) is very similar to that at low transverse momentum. The measured values of charged particle pseudorapidity density and elliptic flow were found to be independent of energy over a broad range of pseudorapidities when effectively viewed in the rest frame of one of the colliding nuclei, a property we describe as ``extended longitudinal scaling''. Finally, the centrality and energy dependences of several observables were found to factorize to a surprising degree.},

  abstract = {In recent years our understanding of neutron stars has advanced remarkably, thanks to research converging from many directions. The importance of understanding neutron star behavior and structure has been underlined by the recent direct detection of gravitational radiation from merging neutron stars. The clean identification of several heavy neutron stars, of order two solar masses, challenges our current understanding of how dense matter can be sufficiently stiff to support such a mass against gravitational collapse. Programs underway to determine simultaneously the mass and radius of neutron stars will continue to constrain and inform theories of neutron star interiors. At the same time, an emerging understanding in quantum chromodynamics (QCD) of how nuclear matter can evolve into deconfined quark matter at high baryon densities is leading to advances in understanding the equation of state of the matter under the extreme conditions in neutron star interiors. We review here the equation of state of matter in neutron stars from the solid crust through the liquid nuclear matter interior to the quark regime at higher densities. We focus in detail on the question of how quark matter appears in neutron stars, and how it affects the equation of state. After discussing the crust and liquid nuclear matter in the core we briefly review aspects of microscopic quark physics relevant to neutron stars, and quark models of dense matter based on the Nambu\textendash Jona\textendash Lasinio framework, in which gluonic processes are replaced by effective quark interactions. We turn then to describing equations of state useful for interpretation of both electromagnetic and gravitational observations, reviewing the emerging picture of hadron-quark continuity in which hadronic matter turns relatively smoothly, with at most only a weak first order transition, into quark matter with increasing density. We review construction of unified equations of state that interpolate between the reasonably well understood nuclear matter regime at low densities and the quark matter regime at higher densities. The utility of such interpolations is driven by the present inability to calculate the dense matter equation of state in QCD from first principles. As we review, the parameters of effective quark models\textemdash which have direct relevance to the more general structure of the QCD phase diagram of dense and hot matter\textemdash are constrained by neutron star mass and radii measurements, in particular favoring large repulsive density-density and attractive diquark pairing interactions. We describe the structure of neutron stars constructed from the unified equations of states with crossover. Lastly we present the current equations of state\textemdash called `QHC18' for quark-hadron crossover\textemdash in a parametrized form practical for neutron star modeling.},

For chiral SU(3), next-to-next-to-leading-order (NNLO) effects play a much greater role. Our main new results are fits of the LECs Li at both next-to-leading order (NLO) and NNLO, making extensive use of the available knowledge of NNLO LECs. We compare our results with available lattice determinations. We then discuss resonance saturation of LECs and the convergence of chiral SU(3) to NNLO. Finally, we review the status of predictions for the LECs of chiral Lagrangians with dynamical photons and leptons.},

All these results are confronted with the predictions of the Hadron Resonance Gas model and Chiral Perturbation Theory for temperatures below the transition region. Our results can be reproduced by using the physical spectrum in these analytic calculations. The findings of the hotQCD collaboration can be recovered by using a distorted spectrum which takes into account lattice discretization artifacts and heavier than physical quark masses.

For \$\textbackslash mu\_I \textbackslash gtrsim 2 m\_\textbackslash pi\$ the leading order chiral perturbation theory breaks down; as an example it underestimates the energy density of the system and leads to a wrong asymptotic behavior.},

  abstract = {When the isospin chemical potential exceeds the pion mass, charged pions condense in the zero-momentum state forming a superfluid. Chiral perturbation theory provides a very powerful tool for studying this phase. However, the formalism that is usually employed in this context does not clarify various aspects of the condensation mechanism and makes the identification of the soft modes problematic. We re-examine the pion condensed phase using different approaches within the chiral perturbation theory framework. As a first step, we perform a low-density expansion of the chiral Lagrangian valid close to the onset of the Bose-Einstein condensation. We obtain an effective theory that can be mapped to a Gross-Pitaevskii Lagrangian in which, remarkably, all the coefficients depend on the isospin chemical potential. The low-density expansion becomes unreliable deep in the pion condensed phase. For this reason, we develop an alternative field expansion deriving a low-energy Lagrangian analog to that of quantum magnets. By integrating out the ``radial'' fluctuations we obtain a soft Lagrangian in terms of the Nambu-Goldstone bosons arising from the breaking of the pion number symmetry. Finally, we test the robustness of the second-order transition between the normal and the pion condensed phase when next-to-leading-order chiral corrections are included. We determine the range of parameters for turning the second-order phase transition into a first-order one, finding that the currently accepted values of these corrections are unlikely to change the order of the phase transition.},

Also, we analyze the dependence of various observables on the mass of the two lightest quarks in some detail, in view of the extrapolations required to reach the small physical masses on the lattice. The analysis relies on the standard hypothesis, according to which the quark condensate is the leading order parameter of the spontaneously broken symmetry. Our results provide the basis for an experimental test of this hypothesis, in particular in the framework of the ongoing DIRAC experiment: the prediction for the lifetime of the ground state of a {$\pi$}+{$\pi-$} atom reads {$\tau$}=(2.9{$\pm$}0.1)\texttimes 10-15s.},

  abstract = {Starting with the modern developments of current algebra and the hypothesis of partially conserved axial-vector current, it has gradually become apparent that the strong interactions are almost invariant under the group SU(3){$\otimes$}SU(3). In the limit that symmetry breaking is neglected, SU(3){$\otimes$}SU(3) does not appear as a symmetry of the particle states as SU(3) does, but rather as a symmetry realized by eight Goldstone bosons, i.e., the pseudoscalar octet. Most papers on SU(3){$\otimes$}SU(3) symmetry have been concerned with soft-meson theorems and their connection with effective Lagrangians. This paper is devoted to other aspects of the symmetry. Part of the paper is frankly pedagogical. The physics behind a symmetry realized by way of Goldstone bosons is brought out through a study of the {$\sigma$} model. Then the general principles are stated abstractly and applied to the hadrons. One of the new results presented here is that there are two distinct ways in which SU(3){$\otimes$}SU(3) can be realized. In both cases there is an octet of massless pseudoscalar mesons. The two possibilities differ in the residual symmetry of the hadron spectrum: In one case, it is only SU(3); in the other, it is SU(3) times a discrete symmetry, which leads to parity doublets. It is conjectured that some of the observed parity doubling in nucleon resonances is a consequence of this new discrete symmetry. Symmetry breaking is discussed in detail and is found to be very complex. In particular, it is shown that, at least for the pseudoscalar-meson masses, octet enhancement can never occur for first-order perturbations around an SU(3){$\otimes$}SU(3)-symmetrical limit. Since octet enhancement is an empirical fact, one is forced to conclude that lowest-order perturbation theory is not a good approximation. In connection with octet enhancement, we show how one can use a principle of pole dominance in the angular momentum plane to replace scalar "tadpole" mesons with Regge trajectories.},

The claim to have obtained the most general Lagrangian relies on this systematic construction and on the elimination of redundant quantities using relations of which we are aware, rather than on a general formal proof of either completeness or independence. The ``equation-of-motion'' terms, which are redundant in the sense that they can be transformed away via field transformations, are separated out explicitly. The resulting Lagrangian has been separated into groupings of terms contributing to increasingly more complicated processes, so that one does not have to deal with the full result when calculating p6 contributions to simple processes. \textcopyright{} 1995 The American Physical Society.},

We propose a convention for disentangling these two effects: one matches the parameters of two theories -- with and without electromagnetic interactions -- at a given scale mu\_1, referred to as the matching scale. This procedure enables one to analyze the separation of strong and electromagnetic contributions in a transparent manner. We illustrate the method -- in the framework of the loop expansion -- in a Yukawa model, as well as in the linear sigma model, where we also investigate the corresponding low-energy effective theory.},

The thermodynamical behaviour is similar to that of boiling; the boiling temperatureT0 is not exactly known but near to 160 MeV; its value and the whole thermodynamic behaviour of hadronic matter follow uniquely from the hadronic mass spectrum. Namely, in this model, as a consequence of a kind of asymptotic bootstrap involving all hadrons, the mass spectrum of hadrons turns out to grow necessarily like exp [m/T0] whereT0 is the highest possible temperature (boiling point of hadronic matter). Global aspects of hadron collisions from {$\sim$}10 GeV/c up to the highest cosmic-ray primary momenta ({$>$}105 GeV/c) namely: production rates, differential momentum spectra of secondaries, transverse-momentum distributions, etc., agree well with the calculations based on this model. The known part of the hadronic mass spectrum does indeed grow exponentially and the mean transverse momenta of pions produced between 10 and 105 GeV/c primary momentum correspond toT{$\approx$}120 to 160 MeV. The following speculative picture emerges: these seems to exist a highest temperature (or boiling point of hadronic matter)T0{$\approx$}160 MeV; hadronic matter in collisions above some ten GeV/c primary momentum is in a state whereall hadrons melt by way of a universal hadronic bootstrap, into \guillemotleft boiling hadronic matter\guillemotright{} in which strong collective motions in the direction of the collision axis coexist with local thermodynamical equilibrium.},

These simulations are performed on an 83\texttimes 4 lattice at three different quark masses. Our estimate of the magnitude of the fluctuations of the phase of the fermion determinant at small quark-number chemical potential {$\mu$}, suggest that the position of the small {$\mu$} and small {$\mu$}I transitions should be the same for {$\mu$}I=2{$\mu$}, and we argue that the nature of these transitions should be the same. For all {$\mu$}I{$<$}m{$\pi$} the smoothness of these transitions and the values of the Binder cumulant B4, indicate that these transitions are mere crossovers, and show no sign of a critical endpoint corresponding to that expected at finite {$\mu$}. This suggests that this finite {$\mu$} critical endpoint, if it exists, lies at {$\mu>$}m{$\pi$}/2 over the considered range of quark masses. For {$\mu$}I{$>$}m{$\pi$} and a small isospin (I3) breaking term {$\lambda$}, we do find evidence of a critical endpoint which would indicate that, for {$\lambda$}=0, there is a tricritical point on the phase boundary where the pion condensate evaporates, where this phase transition changes from second to first-order.},

It then introduces the Riemann curvature tensor, and quickly moves on to submanifold theory in order to give the curvature tensor a concrete quantitative interpretation. From then on, all e?orts are bent toward proving the four most fundamental theorems relating curvature and topology: the Gauss\textendash Bonnet theorem (expressing thetotalcurvatureofasurfaceintermsofitstopologicaltype),theCartan\textendash{} Hadamard theorem (restricting the topology of manifolds of nonpositive curvature), Bonnet's theorem (giving analogous restrictions on manifolds of strictly positive curvature), and a special case of the Cartan\textendash Ambrose\textendash{} Hicks theorem (characterizing manifolds of constant curvature). Many other results and techniques might reasonably claim a place in an introductory Riemannian geometry course, but could not be included due to time constraints.},

  abstract = {This book is an introductory graduate-level textbook on the theory of smooth manifolds. Its goal is to familiarize students with the tools they will need in order to use manifolds in mathematical or scientific research--- smooth structures, tangent vectors and covectors, vector bundles, immersed and embedded submanifolds, tensors, differential forms, de Rham cohomology, vector fields, flows, foliations, Lie derivatives, Lie groups, Lie algebras, and more. The approach is as concrete as possible, with pictures and intuitive discussions of how one should think geometrically about the abstract concepts, while making full use of the powerful tools that modern mathematics has to offer. Along the way, the book introduces students to some of the most important examples of geometric structures that manifolds can carry, such as Riemannian metrics, symplectic structures, and foliations. The book is aimed at students who already have a solid acquaintance with general topology, the fundamental group, and covering spaces, as well as basic undergraduate linear algebra and real analysis. John M. Lee is Professor of Mathematics at the University of Washington in Seattle, where he regularly teaches graduate courses on the topology and geometry of manifolds. He was the recipient of the American Mathematical Society's Centennial Research Fellowship and he is the author of two previous Springer books, Introduction to Topological Manifolds (2000) and Riemannian Manifolds: An Introduction to Curvature (1997).},

Considering a system at vanishing temperature and varying the isospin chemical potential and the strange quark chemical potential we reproduce known results about the phase transition to the pion condensation phase and to the kaon condensation phase. However, we obtain mesonic mixings and masses in the condensed phases that are in disagreement with the results reported in previous works. Our findings are obtained both by a theory group analysis and by direct calculation by means of the same low-energy effective Lagrangian used in previous works. We also study the leptonic decay channels in the normal phase and in the pion condensed phase, finding that some of these channels have a peculiar nonmonotonic behavior as a function of the isospin chemical potential. Regarding the semileptonic decays, we find that they are feeding processes for the stable charged pion state.},

Chapter 4 deals with mesonic chiral perturbation theory and the principles entering the construction of the chiral Lagrangian are outlined. Various examples with increasing chiral orders and complexity are given. Finally, in Chap. 5 the methods are extended to include the interaction between Goldstone bosons and baryons in the single-baryon sector, with the main emphasis put on the heavy-baryon formulation.

  abstract = {QCD at a finite isospin chemical potential {$\mu$}I is studied. This theory has no fermion-sign problem and can be simulated on a lattice by using present-day techniques. We solve this theory analytically in two limits: low {$\mu$}I, where chiral perturbation theory is applicable, and asymptotically high {$\mu$}I, where perturbative QCD is at work. At a low isospin density, the ground state is a superfluid pion condensate. At a very high density, it is a Fermi liquid with Cooper pairing. The pairs carry the same quantum numbers as the pions. Motivated by this observation, we put forward a conjecture that the transition from hadron to quark matter is smooth. The conjecture passes several nontrivial tests. Our results imply a nontrivial phase diagram in the space of the temperature and chemical potentials of isospin and baryon number. At asymptotically large values of {$\mu$}I and small values of the baryon chemical potential, the ground state is in a phase similar to the Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov phase. It is characterized by a spatially modulated superfluid order parameter {$\langle$}\=u{$\gamma$}5d{$\rangle$} and may be the asymptotic limit of the inhomogeneous pion-condensation phase advocated by Migdal and others.},

A hadron resonance gas model with pion interactions, based on first-principle lattice QCD simulations at nonzero isospin density, is used to evaluate cosmic trajectories at various values of electron, muon, and tau lepton asymmetries that satisfy the available constraints on the total lepton asymmetry. The cosmic trajectory can pass through the pion condensed phase if the combined electron and muon asymmetry is sufficiently large: |le+l{$\mu$}|{$\greaterequivlnt$}0.1, with little sensitivity to the difference le-l{$\mu$} between the individual flavor asymmetries. Future constraints on the values of the individual lepton flavor asymmetries will thus be able to either confirm or rule out the condensation of pions during the cosmic QCD epoch. We demonstrate that the pion condensed phase leaves an imprint both on the spectrum of primordial gravitational waves and on the mass distribution of primordial black holes at the QCD scale, e.g., the black hole binary of recent LIGO event GW190521 can be formed in that phase.},

Pursuing an effective field theory approach is a methodology for constructing theories, where a set of core principles is agreed upon, such as Lorentz symmetry and unitarity, and all possible interactions consistent with them are then compulsory in the theory. The utility of this approach to particle physics (and beyond) is wide ranging and undisputed, as evidenced by the recent formation of the international seminar series All Things EFT (Talks in the series can be viewed at https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1\_KF6kdJFoDEcLgpcegwCQ(accessed 21 December 2020).) which brings together each week the worldwide community of EFT practitioners. The text below is a lightly edited version of the talk given by Prof. Weinberg on September 30, 2020, which inaugurated the series. The talk reviews some of the early history of EFTs from the perspective of its pioneer and concludes with a discussion of EFT implications for future discovery.},
