  abstract = {We consider three-flavor chiral perturbation theory ({$\chi$}PT) at zero temperature and nonzero isospin ({$\mu$}I) and strange ({$\mu$}S) chemical potentials. The effective potential is calculated to next-to-leading order (NLO) in the {$\pi\pm$}-condensed phase, the K{$\pm$}-condensed phase, and the \$\$ \{K\}\^0/\{\textbackslash overline\{K\}\}\^0 \$\$-condensed phase. It is shown that the transitions from the vacuum phase to these phases are second order and take place when, \$\$ \textbackslash left|\{\textbackslash mu\}\_I\textbackslash right|=\{m\}\_\{\textbackslash pi \},\textbackslash left|\textbackslash frac\{1\}\{2\}\{\textbackslash mu\}\_I+\{\textbackslash mu\}\_S\textbackslash right|=\{m\}\_K \$\$, and \$\$ \textbackslash left|-\textbackslash frac\{1\}\{2\}\{\textbackslash mu\}\_I+\{\textbackslash mu\}\_S\textbackslash right|=\{m\}\_K \$\$, respectively at tree level and remains unchanged at NLO. The transition between the two condensed phases is first order. The effective potential in the pion-condensed phase is independent of {$\mu$}S and in the kaon-condensed phases, it only depends on the combinations \$\$ \textbackslash pm \textbackslash frac\{1\}\{2\}\{\textbackslash mu\}\_I+\{\textbackslash mu\}\_S \$\$and not separately on {$\mu$}I and {$\mu$}S. We calculate the pressure, isospin density and the equation of state in the pion-condensed phase and compare our results with recent (2 + 1)-flavor lattice QCD data. We find that the three-flavor {$\chi$}PT results are in good agreement with lattice QCD for {$\mu$}I {$<$} 200 MeV, however for larger values {$\chi$}PT produces values for observables that are consistently above lattice results. For {$\mu$}I {$>$} 200 MeV, the two-flavor results are in better agreement with lattice data. Finally, we consider the observables in the limit of very heavy s-quark, where they reduce to their two-flavor counterparts with renormalized couplings. The disagreement between the predictions of two and three flavor {$\chi$}PT can largely be explained by the differences in the experimental values of the low-energy constants.},

We use the two-particle irreducible effective action to leading order in the \$1/N\$-expansion to describe charged and neutrals pions as well as the sigma particle. Tuning the parameters in the Lagrangian correctly, the onset of Bose-Einstein condesation of charged pions is exactly at \$\textbackslash mu\_I=m\_\{\textbackslash pi\}\$, where \$\textbackslash mu\_I\$ is the isospin chemical potential. We calculate the pressure, energy density, and equation of state, which are used as input to the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkov equations. Solving these equations, we obtain the mass radius-relation for pion stars. Global electric charge neutrality is ensured by adding the contribution to the pressure and energy density from a gas of free relativistic leptons. We compare our results with those of recent lattice simulations and find good agreement. The masses of the pion stars are up to approximately 200 solar masses while the corresponding radii are of the order of \$10\^5\$ km.},

  abstract = {When the isospin chemical potential exceeds the pion mass, charged pions condense in the zero-momentum state forming a superfluid. Chiral perturbation theory provides a very powerful tool for studying this phase. However, the formalism that is usually employed in this context does not clarify various aspects of the condensation mechanism and makes the identification of the soft modes problematic. We re-examine the pion condensed phase using different approaches within the chiral perturbation theory framework. As a first step, we perform a low-density expansion of the chiral Lagrangian valid close to the onset of the Bose-Einstein condensation. We obtain an effective theory that can be mapped to a Gross-Pitaevskii Lagrangian in which, remarkably, all the coefficients depend on the isospin chemical potential. The low-density expansion becomes unreliable deep in the pion condensed phase. For this reason, we develop an alternative field expansion deriving a low-energy Lagrangian analog to that of quantum magnets. By integrating out the ``radial'' fluctuations we obtain a soft Lagrangian in terms of the Nambu-Goldstone bosons arising from the breaking of the pion number symmetry. Finally, we test the robustness of the second-order transition between the normal and the pion condensed phase when next-to-leading-order chiral corrections are included. We determine the range of parameters for turning the second-order phase transition into a first-order one, finding that the currently accepted values of these corrections are unlikely to change the order of the phase transition.},

The implications for the coupling constants that occur in the effective Lagrangian beyond leading order and also show up in other processes, are discussed. Also, we analyze the dependence of various observables on the mass of the two lightest quarks in some detail, in view of the extrapolations required to reach the small physical masses on the lattice. The analysis relies on the standard hypothesis, according to which the quark condensate is the leading order parameter of the spontaneously broken symmetry. Our results provide the basis for an experimental test of this hypothesis, in particular in the framework of the ongoing DIRAC experiment: the prediction for the lifetime of the ground state of a {$\pi$}+{$\pi-$} atom reads {$\tau$}=(2.9{$\pm$}0.1)\texttimes 10-15s.},

  abstract = {Starting with the modern developments of current algebra and the hypothesis of partially conserved axial-vector current, it has gradually become apparent that the strong interactions are almost invariant under the group SU(3){$\otimes$}SU(3). In the limit that symmetry breaking is neglected, SU(3){$\otimes$}SU(3) does not appear as a symmetry of the particle states as SU(3) does, but rather as a symmetry realized by eight Goldstone bosons, i.e., the pseudoscalar octet. Most papers on SU(3){$\otimes$}SU(3) symmetry have been concerned with soft-meson theorems and their connection with effective Lagrangians. This paper is devoted to other aspects of the symmetry. Part of the paper is frankly pedagogical. The physics behind a symmetry realized by way of Goldstone bosons is brought out through a study of the {$\sigma$} model. Then the general principles are stated abstractly and applied to the hadrons. One of the new results presented here is that there are two distinct ways in which SU(3){$\otimes$}SU(3) can be realized. In both cases there is an octet of massless pseudoscalar mesons. The two possibilities differ in the residual symmetry of the hadron spectrum: In one case, it is only SU(3); in the other, it is SU(3) times a discrete symmetry, which leads to parity doublets. It is conjectured that some of the observed parity doubling in nucleon resonances is a consequence of this new discrete symmetry. Symmetry breaking is discussed in detail and is found to be very complex. In particular, it is shown that, at least for the pseudoscalar-meson masses, octet enhancement can never occur for first-order perturbations around an SU(3){$\otimes$}SU(3)-symmetrical limit. Since octet enhancement is an empirical fact, one is forced to conclude that lowest-order perturbation theory is not a good approximation. In connection with octet enhancement, we show how one can use a principle of pole dominance in the angular momentum plane to replace scalar "tadpole" mesons with Regge trajectories.},

These low-energy coupling constants are found to be dominated by the resonance contributions.

The most difficult part of the construction was developing a systematic strategy so as to get all of the independent terms and eliminate the redundant ones in an efficient way. The claim to have obtained the most general Lagrangian relies on this systematic construction and on the elimination of redundant quantities using relations of which we are aware, rather than on a general formal proof of either completeness or independence. The ``equation-of-motion'' terms, which are redundant in the sense that they can be transformed away via field transformations, are separated out explicitly. The resulting Lagrangian has been separated into groupings of terms contributing to increasingly more complicated processes, so that one does not have to deal with the full result when calculating p6 contributions to simple processes. \textcopyright{} 1995 The American Physical Society.},

The simplest of them, the Teleparallel theory, is equivalent to General Relativity and there are many studies that seek to study its extension to more general functions of the torsion T . The purpose of our study is to consider a family of f (T ) models and apply their corresponding Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkof equations to compact objects such as neutron stars. Consequently, through a numerical analysis, calculate, among other things, the maximum mass allowed by the model for a neutron star, which would also allow us to evaluate which models are in accordance with observations. In the present paper, the first in the series, we show explicitly the set of equations that must be solved, and how to solve it, in order to model compact stars in f (T ) gravity without the need to adopt any particular form for the metric functions or consider any perturbative approach, as has been done in some works in the literature.},

We also consider different cases for vanishing and nonvanishing lepton asymmetry where the latter one is constrained by cosmic microwave background experiments. Our results show that there is up to a few percent deviation in the predicted gravitational wave background in the frequency range around the QCD transition (10-10\textendash 10-7 Hz) for different lattice QCD equations of state, or at larger frequencies for nonvanishing lepton asymmetry using perturbative QCD. Future gravitational wave experiments with high enough sensitivity in the measurement of the amplitude of primordial gravitational waves like SKA, EPTA, DECIGO, and LISA can probe these differences and can shed light on the real nature of the cosmic QCD transition and the existence of a nonvanishing lepton asymmetry in the early Universe.},

We give an overview of the present knowledge on gravitational equilibrium configurations of scalar fields-boson stars-in the framework of a Newtonian and of a general relativistic treatment. The mixed boson-fermion stars are also discussed. The main properties of the boson star, such as total mass and size, depend on the mass of the constituent scalar fields and on the types of interaction, besides gravity, they are subject to. We discuss also the dynamical stability of boson stars and of mixed boson-fermion stars and for the former their formation through gravitational instabilities.},

The book begins with a careful treatment of the machineryofmetrics,connections,andgeodesics,withoutwhichonecannot claim to be doing Riemannian geometry. It then introduces the Riemann curvature tensor, and quickly moves on to submanifold theory in order to give the curvature tensor a concrete quantitative interpretation. From then on, all e?orts are bent toward proving the four most fundamental theorems relating curvature and topology: the Gauss\textendash Bonnet theorem (expressing thetotalcurvatureofasurfaceintermsofitstopologicaltype),theCartan\textendash{} Hadamard theorem (restricting the topology of manifolds of nonpositive curvature), Bonnet's theorem (giving analogous restrictions on manifolds of strictly positive curvature), and a special case of the Cartan\textendash Ambrose\textendash{} Hicks theorem (characterizing manifolds of constant curvature). Many other results and techniques might reasonably claim a place in an introductory Riemannian geometry course, but could not be included due to time constraints.},

  abstract = {This book is an introductory graduate-level textbook on the theory of smooth manifolds. Its goal is to familiarize students with the tools they will need in order to use manifolds in mathematical or scientific research--- smooth structures, tangent vectors and covectors, vector bundles, immersed and embedded submanifolds, tensors, differential forms, de Rham cohomology, vector fields, flows, foliations, Lie derivatives, Lie groups, Lie algebras, and more. The approach is as concrete as possible, with pictures and intuitive discussions of how one should think geometrically about the abstract concepts, while making full use of the powerful tools that modern mathematics has to offer. Along the way, the book introduces students to some of the most important examples of geometric structures that manifolds can carry, such as Riemannian metrics, symplectic structures, and foliations. The book is aimed at students who already have a solid acquaintance with general topology, the fundamental group, and covering spaces, as well as basic undergraduate linear algebra and real analysis. John M. Lee is Professor of Mathematics at the University of Washington in Seattle, where he regularly teaches graduate courses on the topology and geometry of manifolds. He was the recipient of the American Mathematical Society's Centennial Research Fellowship and he is the author of two previous Springer books, Introduction to Topological Manifolds (2000) and Riemannian Manifolds: An Introduction to Curvature (1997).},

However, we obtain mesonic mixings and masses in the condensed phases that are in disagreement with the results reported in previous works. Our findings are obtained both by a theory group analysis and by direct calculation by means of the same low-energy effective Lagrangian used in previous works. We also study the leptonic decay channels in the normal phase and in the pion condensed phase, finding that some of these channels have a peculiar nonmonotonic behavior as a function of the isospin chemical potential. Regarding the semileptonic decays, we find that they are feeding processes for the stable charged pion state.},

  abstract = {The Review summarizes much of particle physics and cosmology. Using data from previous editions, plus 3,324 new measurements from 878 papers, we list, evaluate, and average measured properties of gauge bosons and the recently discovered Higgs boson, leptons, quarks, mesons, and baryons. We summarize searches for hypothetical particles such as supersymmetric particles, heavy bosons, axions, dark photons, etc. Particle properties and search limits are listed in Summary Tables. We give numerous tables, figures, formulae, and reviews of topics such as Higgs Boson Physics, Supersymmetry, Grand Unified Theories, Neutrino Mixing, Dark Energy, Dark Matter, Cosmology, Particle Detectors, Colliders, Probability and Statistics. Among the 120 reviews are many that are new or heavily revised, including a new review on High Energy Soft QCD and Diffraction and one on the Determination of CKM Angles from B Hadrons.The Review is divided into two volumes. Volume 1 includes the Summary Tables and 98 review articles. Volume 2 consists of the Particle Listings and contains also 22 reviews that address specific aspects of the data presented in the Listings.The complete Review (both volumes) is published online on the website of the Particle Data Group (pdg.lbl.gov) and in a journal. Volume 1 is available in print as the PDG Book. A Particle Physics Booklet with the Summary Tables and essential tables, figures, and equations from selected review articles is available in print and as a web version optimized for use on phones as well as an Android app.},

Section 4 presents an overview of Chiral Perturbation Theory, the low-energy realization of Quantum Chromodynamics in the light quark sector. The Chiral Perturbation Theory framework is applied to weak transitions in section 5, where the physics of non-leptonic kaon decays is analyzed. The so-called Heavy Quark Effective Theory is briefly discussed in section 6. The electroweak chiral Effective Field Theory is described in section 7, which contains a brief overview of the effective Lagrangian associated with the spontaneous electroweak symmetry breaking. Some summarizing comments are finally given in section 8.},

The generic symmetry properties of these massless modes are described in detail and two very relevant phenomenological applications are worked out: chiral perturbation theory, the low-energy effective theory of QCD, and the (non-linear) electroweak effective theory. The similarities and differences between these two effective theories are emphasized, and their current status is reviewed. Special attention is given to the short-distance dynamical information encoded in the low-energy couplings of the effective Lagrangians. The successful methods developed in QCD could help us to uncover fingerprints of new physics scales from future measurements of the electroweak effective theory couplings.},

This undergraduate textbook provides a clear, methodical introduction to the theory of stellar structure and evolution. Starting from general principles and axioms, step-by-step coverage leads students to a global, comprehensive understanding of the subject. Throughout, the book uniquely places emphasis on the basic physical principles governing stellar structure and evolution. All processes are explained in clear and simple terms with all the necessary mathematics included. Exercises and their full solutions allow students to test their understanding. This book requires only a basic background in physics and mathematics and assumes no prior knowledge of astronomy. It provides a stimulating introduction for undergraduates in astronomy, physics, planetary science and applied mathematics taking a course on the physics of stars.},

The absolute maximum mass of a neutron star provides a decisive method of observationally distinguishing neutron stars from black holes.},

Chapter 1 serves as a general introduction to the empirical and theoretical foundations which led to the development of chiral perturbation theory. Chapter 2 deals with QCD and its global symmetries in the chiral limit; the concept of Green functions and Ward identities reflecting the underlying chiral symmetry is elaborated. In Chap. 3 the idea of a spontaneous breakdown of a global symmetry is discussed and its consequences in terms of the Goldstone theorem are demonstrated. Chapter 4 deals with mesonic chiral perturbation theory and the principles entering the construction of the chiral Lagrangian are outlined. Various examples with increasing chiral orders and complexity are given. Finally, in Chap. 5 the methods are extended to include the interaction between Goldstone bosons and baryons in the single-baryon sector, with the main emphasis put on the heavy-baryon formulation. At the end, the method of infrared regularization in the relativistic framework is discussed.},

It includes multiple derivations of many important results, with modern methods such as effective field theory and the renormalization group playing a prominent role. Numerous worked examples and end-of-chapter problems enable students to reproduce classic results and to master quantum field theory as it is used today.

  abstract = {QCD at a finite isospin chemical potential {$\mu$}I is studied. This theory has no fermion-sign problem and can be simulated on a lattice by using present-day techniques. We solve this theory analytically in two limits: low {$\mu$}I, where chiral perturbation theory is applicable, and asymptotically high {$\mu$}I, where perturbative QCD is at work. At a low isospin density, the ground state is a superfluid pion condensate. At a very high density, it is a Fermi liquid with Cooper pairing. The pairs carry the same quantum numbers as the pions. Motivated by this observation, we put forward a conjecture that the transition from hadron to quark matter is smooth. The conjecture passes several nontrivial tests. Our results imply a nontrivial phase diagram in the space of the temperature and chemical potentials of isospin and baryon number. At asymptotically large values of {$\mu$}I and small values of the baryon chemical potential, the ground state is in a phase similar to the Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov phase. It is characterized by a spatially modulated superfluid order parameter {$\langle$}\=u{$\gamma$}5d{$\rangle$} and may be the asymptotic limit of the inhomogeneous pion-condensation phase advocated by Migdal and others.},

  abstract = {We investigate the possible formation of a Bose-Einstein condensed phase of pions in the early Universe at nonvanishing values of lepton flavor asymmetries. A hadron resonance gas model with pion interactions, based on first-principle lattice QCD simulations at nonzero isospin density, is used to evaluate cosmic trajectories at various values of electron, muon, and tau lepton asymmetries that satisfy the available constraints on the total lepton asymmetry. The cosmic trajectory can pass through the pion condensed phase if the combined electron and muon asymmetry is sufficiently large: |le+l{$\mu$}|{$\greaterequivlnt$}0.1, with little sensitivity to the difference le-l{$\mu$} between the individual flavor asymmetries. Future constraints on the values of the individual lepton flavor asymmetries will thus be able to either confirm or rule out the condensation of pions during the cosmic QCD epoch. We demonstrate that the pion condensed phase leaves an imprint both on the spectrum of primordial gravitational waves and on the mass distribution of primordial black holes at the QCD scale, e.g., the black hole binary of recent LIGO event GW190521 can be formed in that phase.},

We develop explicit forms of their effective Lagrangian up to the quadratic order in derivatives. We clarify the counting rules of NGB degrees of freedom and completely classify possibilities of such canonically conjugate pairs based on the topology of the coset spaces. Its consequence on the dispersion relations of the NGBs is clarified. We also present simple scaling arguments to see whether interactions among NGBs are marginal or irrelevant, which justifies a lore in the literature about the possibility of symmetry breaking in \$1+1\$ dimensions.},

  abstract = {Editor's note: One of the most important developments in theoretical particle physics at the end of the 20th century and beginning of the twenty-first century has been the development of effective field theories (EFTs). Pursuing an effective field theory approach is a methodology for constructing theories, where a set of core principles is agreed upon, such as Lorentz symmetry and unitarity, and all possible interactions consistent with them are then compulsory in the theory. The utility of this approach to particle physics (and beyond) is wide ranging and undisputed, as evidenced by the recent formation of the international seminar series All Things EFT (Talks in the series can be viewed at https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1\_KF6kdJFoDEcLgpcegwCQ(accessed 21 December 2020).) which brings together each week the worldwide community of EFT practitioners. The text below is a lightly edited version of the talk given by Prof. Weinberg on September 30, 2020, which inaugurated the series. The talk reviews some of the early history of EFTs from the perspective of its pioneer and concludes with a discussion of EFT implications for future discovery.},

In order to apply S-matrix techniques, based on unitarity and analyticity, we introduce an S-matrix associated to this resummation that is free of infrared divergences. This is achieved by removing the diverging phase factor calculated by Weinberg that multiplies the S matrix, and that stems from the virtual infrared gravitons. A scalar graviton-graviton resonance with vacuum quantum numbers (JPC=0++{$<$}math{$><$}msup is="true"{$><$}mrow is="true"{$><$}mi is="true"{$>$}J{$<$}/mi{$><$}/mrow{$><$}mrow is="true"{$><$}mi is="true"{$>$}P{$<$}/mi{$><$}mi is="true"{$>$}C{$<$}/mi{$><$}/mrow{$><$}/msup{$><$}mo linebreak="goodbreak" linebreakstyle="after" is="true"{$>$}={$<$}/mo{$><$}msup is="true"{$><$}mrow is="true"{$><$}mn is="true"{$>$}0{$<$}/mn{$><$}/mrow{$><$}mrow is="true"{$><$}mo linebreak="badbreak" linebreakstyle="after" is="true"{$>$}+{$<$}/mo{$><$}mo linebreak="badbreak" linebreakstyle="after" is="true"{$>$}+{$<$}/mo{$><$}/mrow{$><$}/msup{$><$}/math{$>$}) is obtained as a pole in the nonperturbative S-wave amplitude, which we call the graviball. Its resonant effects along the physical real-s axis may peak at values substantially lower than the UV cutoff squared of the theory. For some scenarios, this phenomenon could have phenomenological consequences at relatively low-energy scales, similarly to the {$\sigma$} resonance in QCD.},

After a brief historical outline, the book begins with the principles of relativity and quantum mechanics, and the properties of particles that follow. Quantum field theory emerges from this as a natural consequence. The classic calculations of quantum electrodynamics are presented in a thoroughly modern way, showing the use of path integrals and dimensional regularization. It contains much original material, and is peppered with examples and insights drawn from the author's experience as a leader of elementary particle research.
