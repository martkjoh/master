  abstract = {Pion stars consisting of Bose-Einstein condensed charged pions have recently been proposed as a new class of compact stars. We use the two-particle irreducible effective action to leading order in the \$1/N\$-expansion to describe charged and neutrals pions as well as the sigma particle. Tuning the parameters in the Lagrangian correctly, the onset of Bose-Einstein condesation of charged pions is exactly at \$\textbackslash mu\_I=m\_\{\textbackslash pi\}\$, where \$\textbackslash mu\_I\$ is the isospin chemical potential. We calculate the pressure, energy density, and equation of state, which are used as input to the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkov equations. Solving these equations, we obtain the mass radius-relation for pion stars. Global electric charge neutrality is ensured by adding the contribution to the pressure and energy density from a gas of free relativistic leptons. We compare our results with those of recent lattice simulations and find good agreement. The masses of the pion stars are up to approximately 200 solar masses while the corresponding radii are of the order of \$10\^5\$ km.},

  abstract = {We investigate the viability of a new type of compact star whose main constituent is a Bose-Einstein condensate of charged pions. Several different setups are considered, where a gas of charged leptons and neutrinos is also present. The pionic equation of state is obtained from lattice QCD simulations in the presence of an isospin chemical potential, and requires no modeling of the nuclear force. The gravitationally bound configurations of these systems are found by solving the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkov equations. We discuss weak decays within the pion condensed phase and elaborate on the generation mechanism of such objects.},

  abstract = {In this chapter, we begin by introducing the simplest type of manifolds, the topological manifolds, which are topological spaces with three special properties that encode what we mean when we say that they ``locally look like {$\mathbb{R}$} n .'' We then prove some important topological properties of manifolds that we use throughout the book. In the second section we introduce an additional structure, called a smooth structure, that can be added to a topological manifold to enable us to do calculus. Following the basic definitions, we introduce a number of examples of manifolds, so you can have something concrete in mind as you read the general theory. At the end of the chapter we introduce the concept of a smooth manifold with boundary, an important generalization of smooth manifolds that will have numerous applications throughout the book.},
