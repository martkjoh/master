In this section, we survey some general properties of quantum field theory that are necessary for chiral perturbation theory.
First, we introduce the path integral, the 1-particle irreducible effective action, and the effective potential.
We will derive Goldstone's theorem and present the CCWZ construction, which is the basis for \chpt, and discuss how to construct effective field theories.




\section{*QFT via path integrals}
\label{section: path integral}

This section is based on \autocite{peskinIntroductionQuantumField1995,weinbergQuantumTheoryFields1995,weinbergQuantumTheoryFields1996,schwartzQuantumFieldTheory2013}

In the path integral formalism, one evaluates quantum observable by integrating the contributions of all possible configurations.
If the system has specified initial and final states, this amounts to all possible paths the system might evolve between these, hence the name.
We assume the reader has some familiarity with this formalism. 
However, if a refresher is needed, \autoref{section: imaginary-time formalism} contains a derivation of the closely related imaginary-time formalism and compares it with the path integral approach.
A summary of functional calculus is given in \autoref{appendix: Functional derivatives}.

In the path integral formalism, the vacuum-to-vacuum transition amplitude, i.e., the probability that that vacuum at $t = -\infty$ evolves to the vacuum at time $t = \infty$, is given by
\begin{equation}
    Z = \lim_{T\rightarrow \infty} \braket{\Omega, T/2|-T/2, \Omega}
    = \lim_{T\rightarrow \infty} \Braket{\Omega| e^{-iHT} |\Omega}
    = \int \D \pi \D \varphi \, \exp{ i \int \dd^4 x \, \left(\pi \dot \varphi - \He[\pi, \varphi]\right) },
\end{equation}
%
where $\ket{\Omega}$ is the vacuum state.
The  $\varphi$ are the fields of the theory, and $\pi$ their canonical momenta. We will work as if $\varphi$ are a bosonic field. 
However, this can be readily generalized to fermions.
By introducing a source term into the Hamiltonian density, $\He \rightarrow \He - J(x)\varphi(x)$, we get the generating functional
%
\begin{equation}
    Z[J] = 
    \int \D \pi \D \varphi \, 
    \exp{ i \int \dd^4 x \, \left(\pi \dot \varphi - \He[\pi, \varphi]+ J\varphi\right)}.
\end{equation}
%
If $\He$ is quadratic in $\pi$, we can complete the square and integrate out $\pi$ to obtain
%
\begin{equation}
    Z[J] = C \int \D \varphi \, \exp{i \int \dd^4 x\, (\Ell[\varphi] + J \varphi)}.
\end{equation}
%
$C$ is infinite, but constant, and will drop out of physical quantities.
In scattering theory, the main objects of study are correlation functions 
$\ex{\varphi(x_1)\varphi(x_2)...} = \inner{\Omega}{T\left\{\varphi(x_1)\varphi(x_2)\dots\right\}}{\Omega}$,
where $T$ is the time ordering operator.
These are given by functional derivatives of $Z[J]$,
%
\begin{equation}
    \label{correlator from generating functional}
    \ex{\varphi(x_1)\varphi(x_2)...}
    = 
    \frac{\int \D \varphi(x)\, [\varphi(x_1)\varphi(x_2)...] e^{i S[\varphi]}}
        {\int \D \varphi(x)\, e^{i S[\varphi]}}
    =
    \frac{1}{Z[0]} \prod_i\left( -i  \fdv{}{J(x_i)} \right) Z[J]\Big|_{J = 0},
\end{equation}
%
where
%
\begin{equation}
    S[\varphi] = \int \dd^4 x \, \Ell[\varphi]
\end{equation}
%
is the action of the theory.
The functional derivative is described in \autoref{appendix: Functional derivatives}.
In a free theory, we are able to write
%
\begin{equation}
    Z_0[J] = Z_0[0] \exp{i W_0[J]}, \quad 
    iW_0[J] = -\frac{1}{2} \int \dd^4 x \dd^4 y \, J(x) D_0(x - y) J(y),
\end{equation}
%
where $D_0$ is the propagator of the free theory.
Using this form of the generating functional, \autoref{correlator from generating functional} becomes
%
\begin{align*}
    & \frac{1}{Z[0]}  (-i)^n\fdv{}{J(x_1)} ... \fdv{}{J(x_n)} Z_0[J]  \Big|_{J = 0}
    = (-i)^n \fdv{}{J(x_1)} ... \fdv{}{J(x_n)} e^{i W_0[J]} \Big|_{J = 0}\\
    & = (-i)^{n} \fdv{}{J(x_1)} ... \fdv{}{J(x_{n-1})} \left(i \fdv{W_0[J]}{ J(x_{n}) } \right) e^{i W_0[J]} \Big|_{J = 0}\\
    & = (-i)^{n}\fdv{}{J(x_1)} ... \fdv{}{J(x_{n-2})}
    \left(
        i\fdv{ W_0[J] }{ J(x_{n-1}), J(x_{n}) }
        + i^2 \fdv{W_0[J]}{J(x_{n-1})} \fdv{W_0[J]}{J(x_{n})}
    \right) 
    e^{i W_0[J]} \Big|_{J = 0}
    = \dots \\
    &= 
    (- i )^{\floor{n/2}}\sum_{{(a, b)}} \prod_{i=1}^{\floor{n/2}}
    \fdv{ W_0[J] }{J(x_{a(i)}),J(x_{b(i)})} \Big|_{J = 0}.
\end{align*}
%
In the last line, we have introduced the functions $a, \, b$, which define a way to pair $n$ elements.
$\floor{\cdot}$ is the floor function.
The domain of these functions are the integers between $1$ and $\floor{n/2}$, the image a subset of the integers between $1$ and $n$ of size $\floor{n/2}$.
A valid pairing is a set $\{(a(1), b(1)), \dots (a(\floor{n/2}), b(\floor{n/2}))\}$, where all elements $a(i)$ and $b(j)$ are different, such that all integers up to and including $n$ are featured.
A pair is not directed, so $(a(i), b(i))$ is the same pair as $(b(i), a(i))$.
The sum is over the set ${\{(a, b)\}}$ of all possible, unique pairings.
If $n$ is odd, the expression is equal to $0$.
This is Wick's theorem, and it can more simply be stated as \emph{a correlation function is the sum of all possible pairings of 2-point functions},
%
\begin{equation}
    \ex{{\prod}_{i=1}^{n} \varphi(x_i)  }_0
    = \sum_{\{(a, b)\}}  \prod_{i=1}^{\floor{n/2}}  \ex{\varphi(x_{a(i)}) \varphi(x_{b(i)})}_0.
\end{equation}
%
The subscript on the expectation value indicates that it is evaluated in the free theory.

If we have an interacting theory, that is, a theory with an action $S = S_0 + S_I$, where $S_0$ is a free theory, the generating functional can be written
%
\begin{equation}
    \label{partition function of interacting theory}
    Z[J] 
    = Z_0[0] \ex{\exp{iS_I + i\int \dd^4 x \, J(x) \varphi(x)}}_0.
\end{equation}
%
We can expand the exponential in power series, which means the expectation value in \autoref{partition function of interacting theory} becomes
%
\begin{equation}
    \sum_{n, m} \frac{1}{n! m!} \ex{(iS_I)^n \left(i\int \dd^4 x \, J(x) \varphi(x)\right)^m}_0.
\end{equation}
%
The terms in this series are represented by Feynman diagrams, constructed using the Feynman rules, and can be read from the action.
We will not further detail how the Feynman rules are derived.
The Feynman rules for a free scalar field in thermal field theory are derived in \autoref{section: interacting scalar}, and the general procedure is found in any of the main sources for this section~\autocite{peskinIntroductionQuantumField1995,schwartzQuantumFieldTheory2013,weinbergQuantumTheoryFields1995,weinbergQuantumTheoryFields1996}
The source terms give rise to an additional vertex
%
\begin{equation}
    \feynmandiagram [horizontal=a to b]{
        a -- [fermion] b [dot]
    }; \, \, J(x).
\end{equation}

The generating functional $Z[J]$ thus equals $Z_0[0]$ times \emph{the sum of all diagrams with external sources $J(x)$}.

Consider a general diagram without external legs, built up of $N$ different connected subdiagrams, where subdiagram $i$ appears $n_i$ times.
As an illustration, a generic vacuum diagram in $\varphi^4$-theory has the form
%
\begin{align}
    % From: https://www.aidansean.com/feynman/
    \label{Feynman diagrams}
    \Em = 
    \includegraphics[width=0.60\textwidth, valign=c]{figurer/feynman-diagram/diagram_sum.pdf}
    \dots
\end{align}
%
If sub-diagram $i$ as a stand-alone diagram equals $\Em_i$, each copy of that subdiagram contributes a factor $\Em_i$ to the total diagram.
However, due to the symmetry of permuting identical subdiagrams, one must divide by the extra symmetry factor $s = n_i !$, the total number of permutations of all the copies of diagram $i$.
The full diagram therefore equals
%
\begin{align}
    \Em
    = \prod_{i= 1}^N \frac{1}{n_i!} \Em_i^{n_i}.
\end{align}
%
$\Em$ is uniquely defined by a finite sequence of integers, $(n_1, n_2, \dots n_N, 0, 0, \dots)$, so the sum of all diagrams is the sum over the set $S$ of all finite sequences of integers.
This allows us to write the sum of all diagrams as
%
\begin{equation}
    \label{sum of all diagrams}
    \sum_{(n_1, ...)\in S} \prod_{i} \frac{1}{n_i!} \Em_i^{n_i}
    = \prod_{i = 1}^{\infty} \sum_{n_i=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n_i!} \Em_i^{n_i}
    = \exp{{\sum}_i \Em_i}.
\end{equation}
%
We showed that the generating functional $Z[J]$ were the $Z_0[0]$ times the sum of all diagrams due to external sources.
From \autoref{sum of all diagrams}, if we define
%
\begin{equation}
    Z[J] = Z_0[0]\exp{i W[J]},
\end{equation}
%
then $W[J]$ is the sum of all connected diagrams. This is trivially true for the free theory, where the only connected diagram is
%
\begin{equation}
    \label{generating functional of connected diagrams}
    W_0[J] = J(x) \,\,
    \feynmandiagram [horizontal=a to b]{
        a [dot] -- [fermion] b [dot]
    };
    \,\,
    J(y).
\end{equation}
%
The two-point function in the full, interacting theory can thus be written
%
\begin{equation}
    -i \fdv{W[J]}{J(x),J(y)} = D(x - y).
\end{equation}
