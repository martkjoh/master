\subsection{Groups}
Lie groups are a natural structure to capture the symmetries of a physical theory.
A Lie group is a smooth manifold, with the additional structure of a \emph{group}.
A group is a set, $G$, together with a map
%
\begin{align}
    (\cdot, \cdot):  G \times G &\longmapsto G ,\\
    (g_1, g_2) &\longmapsto g_3,
\end{align}
% 
called group multiplication. This map obeys the group axioms, which are the existence of an identity element $\one$, associativity and the existence of an inverse element $g^{-1}$ for all $\in G$.
These can be written as
\begin{table}[!h]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{l l}
        $\forall g \in G, $&$ (g, \one) = g, $\\
        $\forall g_1, g_2, g_3 \in G, $ & $ (g_1, (g_2, g_3)) = ((g_1, g_2), g_3), $\\
        $\forall g \in G,\, \exists g^{-1} \in G,\, \text{s.t.}, $ & $ (g, g^{-1}) = \one.$
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

In addition, we require that both the multiplication map and the inverse map, $g \mapsto g^{-1}$, are smooth.
As we will discuss later, a symmetry transformation is a map between physical states which leave the equations governing that system unchanged.
Assume the field, or set of fields, $\varphi$ is governed by the equation $f(\varphi) = 0$.
A symmetry transformation $\varphi \mapsto g \varphi$ will then obey $f(g\varphi) = 0$.
This is what makes groups the natural structures to describe symmetries.
Assume $G$ is the set of all, or a subset closed under compositions, symmetries of a system,
%
\begin{equation}
    G = \setbuilder{g}{f(g\varphi) = 0},
\end{equation}
%
as a Lie group.
The group $G$ might act on $\varphi$ linearly, so $(g\varphi)_i = g_{ij}\varphi_j$, or in a more complicated matter.
In this case, the group multiplication is composition, i.e., performing transformations in succession.
This map is closed, as the composite of two symmetry transformations is another symmetry transformation.
The identity map is a symmetry transformation, and composition is associative.
This means that invertible symmetry transformations form a group.

We will focus on connected Lie groups, in which all elements $g \in G$ are in the same connected piece as the identity map $\one \varphi = \varphi$.
This means that for each $g\in G$, one can find a continuous path $\gamma(t)$ in the manifold, such that $\gamma(0) = \one$ and $\gamma(1) = g$.
Given such a path, we can study transformations close to the identity element.
As the Lie group is a smooth manifold, we can write\footnote{
    The factor $i$ is a physics convention and differs from how mathematicians define generators of a Lie group.
    }
\begin{equation}
    \gamma(\epsilon) = \one + i \epsilon V + \Oh(\epsilon).
\end{equation}
%
$V$ is a generator, and is defined as
\begin{equation}
    iV = \odv{\gamma}{t}\Big|_{t=0}.
\end{equation}
%
The generator is thus a member of the tangent space of the identity element, $T_\one G$.
We denote the coordinates of $G$ by $\eta_\alpha \in \R^n$.
As before, we can denote a path $\gamma$ in a manifold $G$ by its path through $ \R^n$, $\gamma(t) = g(\eta(t))$.
We will assume, without loss of generality, that $\eta_\alpha(0) = 0$ and $g(0) = \one$.
We can then write the generator as
%
\begin{equation}
    V = \odv{\gamma}{t}\Big|_{t=0} = \odv{\eta_\alpha}{t}\Big|_{t=0} \pdv{g}{\eta_\alpha}\Big|_{\eta=0}
    = v_\alpha T_\alpha, \quad 
    T_\alpha = \odv{\eta_\alpha}{t}\Big|_{t=0}, \quad
    \pdv{g}{\eta_\alpha}\Big|_{\eta=0}.
\end{equation}
%
Infinitesimal transformations can therefore be written as
\begin{equation}
    \gamma(\epsilon) = \one + i \epsilon v_\alpha T_\alpha + \Oh{\epsilon}.
\end{equation}


\subsection{Lie algebra}
The tangent space $T_\one G$, together with the additional operation
\begin{align}
    \label{structure constants}
    [T_\alpha, T_\beta] = iC_{\alpha\beta}^\gamma T_\gamma,
\end{align}
%
called the Lie bracket, form a Lie algebra denoted $\mathfrak{g}$.
$C_{\alpha \beta}^\gamma$ are called structure constants.
They obey the Jacobi identity,
\begin{equation}
    \label{jacobi identity}
    C_{\alpha \beta}^\gamma + C_{\beta\gamma}^\alpha +  C_{\gamma\alpha}^\beta = 0,
\end{equation}
%
which mean that they are totally antisymmetric.
For matrix groups, which we deal with in this text, the Lie bracket is the commutator.
A subset of the original Lie group, $H \subset G$, closed under the group action, is called a subgroup.
$H$ then has its own Lie algebra $\mathfrak{h}$, with a set of $m = \dim H$ generators, $t_a$, which is a subset of the original generators $T_\alpha$.
We denote the remaining set of generators $x_i$, such that $t_a$ and $x_i$ together span $\mathfrak{g}$.
The commutators of $t_a$ must be closed, which means that we can write
%
\begin{align}
    [t_a, t_b] &= i C_{ab}^{c} t_c,\\
    [t_a, x_i] &= i C_{ai}^k x_k, \\
    [x_i, x_j] &= i C_{ij}^k x_k + i C_{ij}^c t_c,
\end{align}
%
where $abc$ runs over the generators of $\mathfrak h$, and $ijk$ runs over the rest.
The second formula can be derived using the Jacobi identity \autoref{jacobi identity}, which implies that $C_{ab}^k = 0 = -C_{ak}^b$.
This is called a Cartan decomposition.

One parameter subgroups are one special case of Lie subgroups.
If a curve $\gamma(t)$ through $G$ obey
%
\begin{equation}
    \gamma(t)\gamma(s) = \gamma(t + s), \quad \gamma(0) = \one,
\end{equation}
%
then all the points on this curve from a one parameter subgroup of $G$.
This path is associated with a generator, 

\begin{equation}
    \odv{\gamma}{t} \Big|_{t=0} = i \eta_\alpha T_\alpha.
\end{equation}
%
This association is one-to-one, and allows us to define the exponential map,
\begin{equation}
    \exp{i \eta_\alpha T_\alpha} := \gamma(1).
\end{equation}
%
For connected and compact Lie groups, all elements of the Lie group $g \in G$ can be written as an exponential of elements in the corresponding Lie algebra $\eta_\alpha T_\alpha \in \mathfrak g$.
For matrix groups, the exponential equals the familiar series expansion
%
\begin{equation}
    \exp{X} = \sum_n \frac{1}{n!} X^n.
\end{equation}
