As we found in \autoref{section: TOV equation}, the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation, \autoref{TOV}, determines the pressure as a function of the radius of a star given the equation of state and the central pressure.
From \autoref{chapter: thermodynamics}, we have various equations of state for the pion condensate.
In this chapter, we will apply these results to study pion stars, bosonic stars composed of a gravitationally bound pion condensate, first proposed by \citeauthor{brandtNewClassCompact2018}~\autocite{brandtNewClassCompact2018}.



\section{Units and limiting radius}

We can gain some insights by reviewing the characteristic quantities of the problem.
The characteristic mass and length, as discussed in \autoref{section: TOV equation}, are found by setting $k_1 = k_2 = k_3 = 1$.
These are the dimensionless constants of the TOV equation, \autoref{dimensionless constants TOV}.
At leading order, the bare constants $f$ and $\bar m$ are related to physical constants by $f = f_\pi$ and $m = m_\pi$, the pion decay constant and the pion mass.
Using the values for $f_\pi$ and $m_\pi$ as given in \autoref{section: units} and reinstating $c$ and $\hbar$, these quantities are given by
%
\begin{align}
    u_0 & =m_\pi^2 f_\pi^2 \frac{c}{\hbar^3}
    = 3.216\cdot 10^{33} \, \text{J}\,\text{m}^{-3}, \\
    m_0 & = \frac{c^4}{\sqrt{\frac{4 \pi}{ 3} u_0 G^3}} = 64.21\, M_\odot, \\
    r_0 & = \frac{G}{c^2} m_0 = 94.79 \, \text{km}.
\end{align}
%
We, therefore, expect both the radius and mass of the pion star to be around one order of magnitude larger than the star made up of cold neutrons.
\todo[inline]{Can we make a better argument by setting gravitational + internal energy equal 0?}


In \autoref{section: thermodynamics leading order}, we found that the leading order, the non-relativistic limit of the equation of state of a pure pion-condensate, without electromagnetic interaction, is $\tilde p =8^{-1} \tilde u^2$.
That is, it is a polytrope with $\gamma = 2$.
As discussed in \autoref{subsection: Newtonian limit and polytropes}, this corresponds to a situation where the radius of the star is independent of the central pressure, at least in the Newtonian limit of gravity.
When simulating the Newtonian, non-relativistic limit of the pion star, we should expect the radius to be constant.
From \autoref{Radius polytrope}, the radius is $R = C \xi_1$, where
%
\begin{equation}
    C = \frac{1}{\sqrt{4(4\pi ) G u_0}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{12}}r_0,
\end{equation}
%
and $\xi_1$ is the root of the Lane-Emden function $\theta(\xi)$ for polytrope index $n=1$, the solution to
%
\begin{equation}
    \theta'' + \frac{2}{\xi} \theta' + \theta = 0.
\end{equation}
%
By substituting $\theta$ for its power series expansion, $\theta = \sum_n a_n \xi^n$, we get
%
\begin{equation}
    \sum_n \left[ (n+2)(n+1) a_{n+2} + 2(n+1) a_{n+1} \xi^{-1} + a_n \right] \xi^n = 0.
\end{equation}
%
This must be obeyed for arbitrary $\xi$.
We therefore get the recursion relation $a_{n+2} = - a_n / (n+1)(n+2)$.
With our boundary condition, the solution is
%
\begin{equation}
    \theta(\xi) = \frac{\sin(\xi)}{\xi},
\end{equation}
%
and the first root is therefore $\xi_1 = \pi$.
With this, we get a closed-form expression for the stellar radius of this non-relativistic and Newtonian limit---which we expect the full theory to approach as the central pressure decreases---namely
%
\begin{equation}
    \label{radius pion star nr limit}
    R = \frac{\pi}{\sqrt{12}} r_0 = 85.97 \, \text{km}.
\end{equation}
%
When including electromagnetic interactions, as done in \autoref{subsection: including electromagnetism lo eos}, the non-relativistic equation of state remains a polytrope with $\gamma=2$, however with a new constant by a factor $(1+\Delta)^2$, where $\Delta = \Delta m^2_\text{EM}/m_\pi^2$.
This affects the maximum radius, which now is
%
\begin{equation}
    \label{maximum mass pion star with em interaction}
    R = \frac{\pi}{\sqrt{12}(1 + \Delta)} r_0 = 80.40 \, \text{km}.
\end{equation}
%
These limits are only available when considering the pion condensate alone, without leptons.
As we found, the inclusion of leptons will change the low-density limit of the equation of state, and it is only for $\gamma=2$ where the Lane-Emden equation admits a non-zero limit radius of this sort.


\section{Numerical results}


\todo[inline]{Pass på at tall i tekst matcher med figurer!}
In this section, we present the results of integrating the TOV-equation numerically.
The computer code used to obtain these results is discussed in \autoref{appendix: code}.

\subsection{Pion star of pure pion condensate}


We start with the simplest case of a pure pion condensate, in which there are only strong interactions, to leading order as described in \autoref{subsection: pure pion condensate}.
The equation of state of this system is shown in \autoref{fig: equation of state pions}.

\autoref{fig: pressure and mass for pion star} show the pressure and mass as a function of radius for varying values of central pressure.
The quantities are normalized to the stellar radius, stellar mass, and central pressure, respectively.
The black dashed line corresponds to the configuration with the maximum mass.
We see that both the pressure and mass distribution are very similar for stars with a mass less than the maximum.
As the central pressure increase beyond that of the star with maximum mass, the pressure gradient close to the center grows sharply.
This is similar to what we saw in the case of an incompressible fluid, \autoref{subsection: incompressible fluid}.

\autoref{fig: mass-radius relation pion star} shows the mass-radius relation for the pion star.
As in the case of the neutron star, it has a maximum mass, in this case of $M_\text{max} = 10.47\, M_\odot$.
However, in contrast to the case of the neutron star, the stellar radius approaches a maximum radius as the central pressure decreases.
This matches our expectation from the non-relativistic, Newtonian limit.
We see that the largest radius in our results, corresponding to  $p_c = 10^{-6} \, p_0$, is $R = 85.82 \, \text{km}$, which is in good agreement with our earlier analysis, \autoref{radius pion star nr limit}.

\autoref{fig: mass-radius relation pion star comparison} compares the mass-radius relation from the full equation of state and TOV equation with various limits.
In the non-relativistic, Newtonian limit, the stellar radius is independent of the mass, as we found in our earlier analysis.

\subsection{Including electromagnetic contributions}

As we found in \autoref{subsection: including electromagnetism lo eos}, the electromagnetic interaction of the pseudoscalar mesons contributes to the equation of state, even at leading order.
\autoref{fig: pressure and energy with EM interaction} shows the pressure and energy density, normalized to their characteristic quantities, as a function of chemical potential above the critical value, normalized to $\bar m$.
\autoref{fig: eos chpt em interaction} shows the equation of state.
The results with and without electromagnetic results are compared.
We see that the inclusion of electromagnetic contributions results in a less stiff equation of state; a given pressure corresponds to a higher energy density when including electromagnetic interactions.

\autoref{fig: mass-radius relation leading order pion star with em interaction} shows the mass-radius reaction of the pion star when the electromagnetic interaction is taken into account.
We see that the shape of the curve has not changed much from our earlier result. 
Both the maximum mass and radius are slightly smaller.
The new result for maximum radius, $R_\text{max} = 80.35 \, \text{km}$, is in excellent agreement with our expectation, \autoref{maximum mass pion star with em interaction}.
The result with and without electromagnetic interaction is compared in \autoref{fig: mass-radius relation comparison}.
As discussed in \autoref{section: cold fermi star}, we expect a stiffer equation of state to correspond to a more massive star, as happens in this case.

\subsection{Charge neutral stars}


We now apply the results from \autoref{section: charge neturality}, where we added a lepton to enforce charge neutrality.
As the electromagnetic force is long-range, we should expect any macroscopic astronomical object to be charge neutral.
First, we apply the system of pions and one charged lepton.
The star with electrons is shown in \autoref{fig: mass-radius relation with electrons}.
We see that this star is much larger than those made of only pions.
This is because the light electrons make the equation of state stiffer at low pressures.
The non-relativistic equation of state is now a polytrope with $\gamma = \frac{5}{3}$, instead of $\gamma = 2$, and there is, therefore, no upper limit on the radius.
The maximum mass is now $238\, M_\odot $, and the corresponding maximum radius is $ 3.11\times 10^4 \,\text{km}$.

The mass-radius relation for a star where the lepton is a muon is shown in \autoref{fig: mass-radius relation with muons}.
This has a similar form to that where the lepton was the electron, only smaller and lighter, as the equation of state, in this case, is less stiff.
The maximum mass is now $18.6\, M_\odot $, and the corresponding maximum radius is $ 262 \,\text{km}$.

        }
        \label{fig: mass-radius relation with muons}
\end{figure}



\subsection{Neutrinos}

In \autoref{subsection: neutrinos}, we found the equation of state when including neutrinos in addition to charged leptons and the decay of pions due to the weak force.
In this case, the pressure and energy density do not vanish as the isospin density vanishes, but rather as $p = p_\text{min}>0$ as defined in \autoref{p min}
This is due to the contribution of neutrinos.
We therefore define the stellar radius $R$ by $p(R) = p_\text{min}$, where the pion condensate vanishes.
Such a star will therefore have an atmosphere of ultrarelativistic neutrinos.
For $p < p_\text{min}$, the equation of state is that of massless fermions and will therefore not have a finite radius.
There is a $p+u$-term on the right-hand side of the TOV equation, \autoref{TOV}.
When we defined the stellar radius by $p(R) = 0$, this factor vanishes as we approach the surface of the star, while now $p+u \geq 4 p_\text{min}$.
Close to the surface, the pressure will therefore fall faster, as a consequence of $p_\text{min}>0$.
The resulting mass-radius relation is shown in \autoref{fig: mass radius neutrino}.
We see that, in contrast to the earlier results, both the mass and radius approach zero as $p_c \rightarrow p_\text{min}$.


\begin{figure}[!htb]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{../scripts/figurer/pion_star/mass_radius_neutrino.pdf}

        The radius is given in kilometers and the mass in units of solar masses.
        }
        \label{fig: mass radius neutrino}
\end{figure}

In \autoref{fig: light stars}, the pion stars including charged leptons and neutrinos are compared to a family of stars with $u = 3p$ but different values for $p_\text{min}$.
We see that the mass-radius relation of the pion star closely resembles that of such a star and that the mass-radius relationship, therefore, is mostly set by $p_\text{min}$.

    \label{fig: light stars}
\end{figure}


\subsection{NLO pion star}

We now use the next-to-leading order results for the pure pion condensate, which we found in \autoref{section: nlo thermodynamics}.
The mass-radius relationship, in this case, is shown in \autoref{fig: mass-radius relation nlo}.
The maximum mass is $M_\text{max} = 9.94\, M_0$, and the corresponding radius is $R = 54.09\,\text{km}$.
In \autoref{fig: mass-radius relation compare nlo}, we compare the leading order and next-to-leading order mass-radius relations.
The results are similar, however, the next-to-leading order star is smaller and less massive, as is expected for a less stiff equation of state.
