In this chapter, we will take the general knowledge from the general theory in \autoref{chapter: QFT} and apply it to the specific case of quantum chromodynamics, which results in \emph{chiral perturbation theory}, or \chpt.

\section{QCD}

\subsection{Yang-Mills theory and Gauge symmetry}


In our discussion on global symmetries, we considered the global transformation of fields by some group $G$.
In gauge theories, we will consider local transformations.
That is, the transformations are themselves functions of spacetime, $U = U(x)$, and take on some value in $G$ for all points in space.
With this, however, we encounter a problem with comparing the value of a field at different points.
As the symmetry is local, a gauge transformation will generally affect the field at two points differently.
We must find a way to compare fields at different points independent of gauge transformations.
This is similar to a problem we have encountered before.
In differential geometry, as described in \autoref{section: differential geometry}, we needed a connection $\Gamma^\rho_{\mu \nu}$ to compare vectors in different tangent spaces in a coordinate independent way.
In gauge theories, we generalize this by defining a connection, $A_\mu$, to compare field values at different points in a gauge-independent way.

Consider a set of $N_c$ fields $\psi_c$, which the symmetry group $\Lie{SU}{N}$ acts linearly on as $\psi_c \rightarrow U_{cc'} \psi_{c'}$.
We can write $U = \exp(i \eta_\alpha T_\alpha)$, where $T_\alpha$ are the generators of $\lie{su}{N_c}_c$, and can therefore be written $A_\mu = A_\mu^\alpha T_\alpha$.
The transformation is then made local by letting the coordinates of $\Lie{SU}{N}$ be functions of spacetime, $\eta_\alpha = \eta_\alpha(x)$.
As we did in \autoref{section: differential geometry}, we define the covariant derivative $D_\mu$ to transform as the thing it acts on.
It has the form
%
\begin{equation}
    D_\mu^{cc'} \psi_{c'} = (\delta_{cc'}\partial_\mu - i g A_\mu^{cc'} )\psi_{c'},
\end{equation}
%
where $A_\mu^{cc'}$ is a new, dynamic field, the gauge field.
This field takes values in the Lie algebra of the gauge group, $\lie{su}{N}$.
We will suppress the $c$-indices for cleaner notation.
This field also transform under the gauge group.
By enforcing the transformation rule $D_\mu A_\nu \rightarrow U D_\mu A_\nu$, we can deduce the transformation properties of the gauge field, 
%
\begin{equation}
    \label{Gauge transformation gauge field}
    A_\mu\rightarrow U \left(A_\mu + \frac{i}{g} \partial_\mu\right) U^\dagger
\end{equation}
%
With the covariant derivative, we can create gauge-invariant terms, such as $\bar \psi D_\mu \psi$.
In \autoref{section: differential geometry} we introduced the Riemann tensor as the commutator of covaraint derivatives, \autoref{Riemann tensor}.
This ensures that it transforms as a tensor and gives us the interpretation as a quantity that measures the amount vectors curved when parallel transported in a small loop.
In analogy, we define the \emph{field strength tensor},
%
\begin{equation}
    G_{\mu \nu} := \frac{i}{g} [D_\mu, D_\nu]
    = \partial_\mu A_\nu - \partial_\nu A_\mu - i g[A_\mu, A_\nu].
\end{equation}
%
$A_\mu$ is an element of a Lie algebra, so the commutator is given by the structure constants of that algebra, \autoref{structure constants}.
The field strength tensor transforms as $G_\mu \rightarrow U G_{\mu \nu}U^\dagger$.
This allows us to create gauge-invariant terms of only this tensor, which, as with the Ricci scalar in general relativity, are the building blocks of the Lagrangian of only the gauge field.
The lowest order terms are
%
\begin{equation}
    G^{\mu \nu}_\alpha G_{\mu \nu}^\alpha, \quad
    \epsilon^{\mu \nu \rho \sigma} G_{\mu \nu}^\alpha G_{\rho \sigma}^\alpha.
\end{equation}
%
Here, $\alpha$ is the index in $\lie{su}{N}$-space.

\subsection{The QCD Lagrangian}

Quantum chromodynamics, or QCD, is the specific gauge theory of quarks $q_{fc}$, spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ particles, interacting via the strong force, a $\Lie{SU}{3}_c$ gauge field denoted $A_\mu$.
There are six quarks $q$, called flavors and indexed by $f$, with an additional quantum number called color indexed by $c$.
The quarks, labeled u, d, s, c, t and b, have different masses.
In this thesis, we will only include the 2 or 3 lightest quark, and will therefore denote the number of flavors by $N_f$.
The Lagrangian of QCD, including only the strong force, is
%
\begin{equation}
    \Ell_{\text{QCD}} 
    = \bar q (i \slashed D - m)q - \frac{1}{4} G_{\mu \nu}^\alpha G^{\mu \nu}_\alpha.
\end{equation}
%
We have suppressed color and flavor indices.
$\slashed D q = \gamma^\mu (\partial_\mu - i g A_\mu) q$ is the covariant derivative associated with the $\Lie{SU}{3}_c$ gauge group with coupling constant $g$, and $\gamma^\mu$ are the Dirac matrices.\todo{skriv appendix med dirac matriser}
The quark mass matrix, $m$, acts on the flavor indexes as the flavor states are mass eigenstates.
There are no known symmetries that forbid a $\epsilon^{\mu \nu \rho \sigma} G_{\mu \nu}^\alpha G_{\rho \sigma}^\alpha$-term, and its absence is dubbed the strong CP problem~\autocite{schwartzQuantumFieldTheory2013}.


\subsection{Chiral symmetry}

If we consider the massless QCD Lagrangian, $m = 0$, it has an additional symmetry of rotation in its flavour indices.
We can project the quarks down to their \emph{chiral} components by introducing projection operators
\begin{equation}
    P_R = \frac{1}{2}\left(1 + \gamma^5\right), \quad
    P_L = \frac{1}{2}\left(1 - \gamma^5\right).
\end{equation}
%
Here, $\gamma^5$ is the ``fifth gamma-matrix'', as described in ().\todo{appendix}
As good projection operators, they obey
%
\begin{equation}
    P_R + P_L = 0, \quad P_R P_L = P_L P_R = 0, \quad P_I^2 = P_I, \, I=R, L.
\end{equation}
%
By the properties of $\gamma^5$ and $\bar q = q^\dagger\gamma^0$, these operators project out the opposite chirality of $q$ and $q$,
%
\begin{equation}
    P_I q = q_I, \quad \bar q  P_I  = q_{\bar I},\quad
    I = R, L, \quad \bar I = L, R. 
\end{equation}
%
With this, we can write the quark-sector of massles QCD as
%
\begin{equation}
    i \bar q \slashed D q
    = i \bar q \slashed D (P_R + P_L)^2 q
    = i \bar q_L \slashed D q_L + i \bar q_R \slashed D q_R.
\end{equation}
%
This operator is invariant under the transformations
%
\begin{equation}
    q \rightarrow U_R q = (P_L + P_R U_R') q, \quad
    q \rightarrow U_L q = (P_R + P_L U_L') q,
\end{equation}
%
where $U_L'$ and $U_R'$ are Hermitian matrices that act on the flavor indices.
These transformations form the Lie group $\Lie{U}{N_f}_R \times \Lie{U}{N_f}_L = \Lie{U}{1}_R \times \Lie{SU}{N_f}_R \times \Lie{U}{1}_L \times \Lie{SU}{N_f}_L $.
This transformation can also be described in terms of the diagonal subgroup, made up of transformations of the form $U_V = U_R U_L$, where $U_R' = U_L'$ and the remaining transformations of the for $U_A = U_L U_R$, where $U_R' = U_L'^\dagger$.
These are called the vector and axial group, and together form $\Lie{U}{N_f}_A \times \Lie{U}{N_f}_V= \Lie{U}{1}_V \times \Lie{SU}{N_f}_V \times \Lie{U}{1}_A \times \Lie{SU}{N_f}_A $
The currents corresponding to conserved currents are
%
\begin{equation}
    J_V^\mu = \bar q_R \gamma^\mu q_R, \quad
    V^\mu_\alpha =  \bar q T_\alpha \gamma^\mu q, \quad
    J_A^\mu = \bar q_L \gamma^\mu \gamma^5 q_L, \quad
    A^\mu_\alpha = \bar q T_\alpha \gamma^\mu \gamma^5 q.
\end{equation}
%
Here, $T_\alpha$ and $T_\alpha \gamma^5$ are the generators of $\Lie{SU}{N_f}_V$ and $\Lie{SU}{N_f}_A$. 
Other bilinears
%
\begin{equation}
    \bar q q,\, \bar q\gamma^5 q,\, \bar q \tau_a q, \, \bar q \tau_a \gamma^5 q. 
\end{equation}
