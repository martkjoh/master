In this chapter, we will take the general knowledge from the general theory in \autoref{chapter: QFT} and apply it to the specific case of quantum chromodynamics, which results in \emph{chiral perturbation theory}, or \chpt.

\section{QCD}

Quantum chromodynamics (QCD) is the theory of how quarks interact via the strong force.
